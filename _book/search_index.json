This disparity is partly due to the complexity involved in comparing migration data and patterns across nations, regions and over time. Several factors contribute to the intricacy of such comparisons: Diverse Definitions of Migration: Nations may employ different definitions of migration, which might alter over time, making it challenging to establish consistent criteria for measuring and comparing migration accurately. Variations in Data Collection Systems: The methods and systems used for collecting migration data can differ among countries, further complicating comparisons. Discrepancies in data collection practices can affect the quality, coverage, and reliability of migration statistics. Heterogeneous Regional Sizes: Spatial units, such as regions or administrative divisions, vary in size across countries. This variation in regional scales can influence the interpretation and analysis of migration patterns, as migration rates may be influenced by the size of the areas being studied. Changing Number of Regions: The number of regions within a country may change over time due to administrative or political reforms. Such changes can disrupt the continuity and consistency of migration data, making it challenging to track migration trends accurately. Diverse Approaches to Distance Measurement: Different regions or countries may adopt varying methods to measure distances between locations. These differences can impact migration analyses that rely on distance-based measures, such as gravity model analyses. Fluctuations in Population Sizes and Structures: The underlying population sizes and demographic structures of regions or countries can change over time. These changes can influence migration patterns and introduce additional complexities when comparing migration data across different time periods or geographic areas. Given these factors, it is important to consider the contextual nuances and data issues when conducting cross-national or temporal comparisons of migration. In recent decades a growing number of summary migration measures and indices have been proposed to attempt to address one or more of the factors above. Bell et al. (2002) brought together many of these measure and extended others to help facilitate the improved comparisons of internal migration across nations. These measures were incorporated into the IMAGE software, to build comparisons of internal migration patterns in multiple countries Bell, Charles-Edwards, Ueffing, et al. (2015), Bell, Charles-Edwards, Kupiszewska, et al. (2015), Stillwell et al. (2016), Rees et al. (2016), and Bernard, Bell, and Charles-Edwards (2014). In the work of Bell et al. (2002), four main groups of migration indices were identified, providing a comprehensive framework for understanding and analyzing migration patterns. These groups include intensity of migration, distance of migration, migration connectivity, and the effect of migration on the redistribution of populations. In the remainder of this chapter we concentrate on available functions in R that can be used to calculate a range of summary migration indices in these four groups, and show how they can be applied to study changes in migration patterns over time or between countries. 4.1 Migration intensity Migration intensity measures focus on capturing the overall level or incidence of mobility within a population. These measures aim to provide a single indicator that allows for comparisons of migration intensities over different time periods or geographical areas. They help researchers understand the relative magnitude of migration flows and sets of regions or periods with higher or lower levels of migration activity. There are a number of age-specific migration intensity measures, that summarise how migration varies across different age groups. We will leave our discussion on these age-specific migration measures to the subsequent chapter on age schedules, where we introduce related migration age schedules that are used in the calculation of some summary indicies. Crude migration intensity is a straightforward measure that provides an indication of the overall propensity to migrate within a population, similar to how crude birth or death rates reflect the overall incidence of births or deaths. When migration transition data is available, the crude migration probability (CMP) can be calculated to estimate the likelihood of migration over the total population; \\[ \\texttt{CMP} = 100 M/P \\] The CMP is calculated by dividing the total number of migrants (\\(M\\)) in a specific time period by the population at risk (\\(P\\)) during that same period. The result is then multiplied by 100 to express it as a percentage. In the study by Courgeau (1973), the relationship between the intensity of migration and the number of regions in a country was examined. It was proposed that the crude migration probability (CMP) can be expressed as a function of the number of regions, denoted as ‘n’, and a constant ‘k’. \\[ \\texttt{CMP} = k \\log (n^2) \\] The value of \\(k\\) in Courgeau’s formula does not have an intrinsic meaning by itself. However, it serves as a scaling factor that allows for comparisons of migration intensity across zonal systems or administrative divisions used to collect migration data. A higher value of \\(k\\) indicates a greater intensity of migration within a set of regions. The migest package offers the index_intensity() function, which facilitates the calculation of migration intensity measures. This function takes a migration and population totals as inputs, alongside a value for the number of regions n, and calculates both intensity measures discussed above. library(migest) index_intensity(mig_total = 25, pop_total = 52, n = 17) ## # A tibble: 2 × 2 ## measure value ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 cmp 48.1 ## 2 courgeau_k 8.48 4.2 Migration distance When comparing migration patterns across different regions, it is important to consider the variations in the intensity of movement across space. Migration is a spatial activity that involves movements between specific locations, and different regions may exhibit varying levels of migration intensity. To capture the effects of distance within a migration system, several measures have been developed. Measuring the distance between regions is not a straightforward task. Ideally, we would want to measure the typical distance that migrants travel. One commonly used approximation is the straight-line distance between the population-weighted centroids of each region. This approach provides a reasonable estimate of average distances moved along a migration corridor, taking into account the spatial distribution of population within each region. The costs faced by migrants may not be accurately represented by the inter-centroid distance alone. There are several factors that can complicate distance measurements. For example, regions located near borders may have centroids that exaggerate the actual distance between them. Regions can vary significantly in shape and size, making it challenging to capture the true distance between them. Additionally, features such as indented coastlines can create cultural and travel cost differences, impacting migration patterns. 4.2.1 Creating distance matrices in R In R, there are various functions available to calculate distance matrices, which are can then be used when analyzing migration patterns. These functions typically require a set of longitude and latitude coordinates to compute the distances between locations accurately. While some national statistics offices may provide these centroids, in many cases such data is not readily available. In such situations, researchers can turn to alternative sources for population-weighted centroid estimates based on gridded population estimates. The POPGRID Data Collaborative brings together multiple research groups that publish estimates of past and future population gridded datasets. These estimates can be used to derive population-weighted centroids and facilitate the calculation of distance matrices for migration analysis. Below we demonstrate how to download the population centroids from the WorldPop, one of the research groups covered by POPGRID. They handily provide CSV files for population centriods for all first-level subregions based on the global population gridded estimates in five-year intervals between 2000 and 2020 (Edwards et al. (2021)). We can read in the data in the 2020 CSV file (the fifth file in the zip folder) using the archive_read function in R to download the zip folder from the WorldPop website and temporarily unzip the file for reading into R. library(tidyverse) library(archive) # read in data pw &lt;- archive_read( archive = &quot;https://data.worldpop.org/GIS/Population_Weighted_Density/Unconstrained_Subnational/100m/PWD_100m_sub_national_CSV.zip&quot;, file = 5 ) %&gt;% read_csv() # view pw ## # A tibble: 3,521 × 25 ## year ISO ISO_No Country_N Adm_N GID_1 HASC PWC_Lat PWC_Lon Pop Density ## &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 2020 RUS 643 Russia Adyg… RUS.… RU.AD 44.8 39.8 5.13e5 66.4 ## 2 2020 RUS 643 Russia Altay RUS.… RU.AL 52.8 83.0 2.28e6 13.9 ## 3 2020 RUS 643 Russia Amur RUS.… RU.AM 51.2 128. 7.75e5 2.2 ## 4 2020 RUS 643 Russia Arkh… RUS.… RU.AR 63.4 41.8 1.10e6 2.8 ## 5 2020 RUS 643 Russia Astr… RUS.… RU.AS 46.6 47.8 1.04e6 23.5 ## 6 2020 RUS 643 Russia Bash… RUS.… RU.BK 54.4 55.9 4.17e6 29.2 ## 7 2020 RUS 643 Russia Belg… RUS.… RU.BL 50.8 37.2 1.63e6 57.7 ## 8 2020 RUS 643 Russia Brya… RUS.… RU.BR 53.0 33.7 1.20e6 35.3 ## 9 2020 RUS 643 Russia Bury… RUS.… RU.BU 52.0 108. 9.96e5 3 ## 10 2020 RUS 643 Russia Chec… RUS.… RU.CN 43.3 45.8 1.49e6 99 ## # … with 3,511 more rows, and 14 more variables: Area &lt;dbl&gt;, PWD_A &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # PWD_G &lt;dbl&gt;, PWD_M &lt;dbl&gt;, PWD_D1 &lt;dbl&gt;, PWD_D2 &lt;dbl&gt;, PWD_D3 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # PWD_D4 &lt;dbl&gt;, PWD_D5 &lt;dbl&gt;, PWD_D6 &lt;dbl&gt;, PWD_D7 &lt;dbl&gt;, PWD_D8 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # PWD_D9 &lt;dbl&gt;, PWD_D10 &lt;dbl&gt; We will use South Korea to demonstrate how calcaulte a populated weighted distance matrix for regions in a particular country kor_pw &lt;- pw %&gt;% filter(ISO == &quot;KOR&quot;) %&gt;% select(Adm_N, PWC_Lat, PWC_Lon, Pop) kor_pw ## # A tibble: 17 × 4 ## Adm_N PWC_Lat PWC_Lon Pop ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Busan 35.2 129. 2925666 ## 2 Chungcheongbuk-do 36.7 128. 1629527 ## 3 Chungcheongnam-do 36.7 127. 2049544 ## 4 Daegu 35.8 129. 2098338 ## 5 Daejeon 36.3 127. 1595088 ## 6 Gangwon-do 37.7 128. 1446914 ## 7 Gwangju 35.2 127. 1396761 ## 8 Gyeonggi-do 37.4 127. 15014585 ## 9 Gyeongsangbuk-do 36.1 129. 2805942 ## 10 Gyeongsangnam-do 35.2 129. 3444121 ## 11 Incheon 37.4 127. 2964572 ## 12 Jeju 33.4 127. 564353 ## 13 Jeollabuk-do 35.8 127. 1641019 ## 14 Jeollanam-do 34.9 127. 1703339 ## 15 Sejong 36.5 127. 61443 ## 16 Seoul 37.5 127. 8889778 ## 17 Ulsan 35.5 129. 1038185 The calculation of distances between centroids can calcualted using the distm() function from the geosphere package.

One approach is to calculate the weighted average of migration counts, where the distances between regions serve as the weights. This provides a summary measure of the average migration distance, taking into account the varying distances between origin and destination pairs. Bell et al. (2002) suggests that the median average distance is preferable to the mean average distance due to the negatively skewed distribution of distances. This skewness reflects the distance decay effect, which consistently influences migration patterns. Comparing the median and mean average distances can provide insights into the degree of skewness in the distribution. To address the skewness and model the relationship between migration counts and distances, a more comprehensive method involves fitting a predictive model. Different models can be utilized, often incorporating a log-transformed distance term and categorical control variables for the origin and destination regions. For example, a Poisson log-linear model can be employed, where the logarithm of the migration count (\\(m_{ij}\\)) is related to the origin, destination, and log-distance as follows: \\[ \\log(m_{ij}) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_{1i} \\texttt{origin} + \\beta_{2j} \\texttt{destination} + \\beta_{3} \\log(\\texttt{distance}) \\] The parameter of interest in this equation is the distance decay parameter (\\(\\beta_3\\)), which indicates the impact of distance on migration. The distance decay parameter is typically negative, implying that an increase in distance leads to a decrease in predicted migration. The set of parameters \\(\\beta_{1i}\\) and \\(\\beta_{2j}\\) represent the push and pull factors specific to each region, capturing the factors influencing migration behavior. 4.2.3 Migration Distance Measures in R The migest package in R provides the index_distance() function, which allows you to calculate three summary distance measures based on a set of migration flows and corresponding distance values between each origin and destination. To use the function, you can provide the origin-destination migration flows as either a matrix or a data frame. If using a data frame, the column names are expected to be orig, dest, and flow. However, you have the flexibility to specify different column names using the orig_col, dest_col, and flow_col arguments. Similarly, the distance values can be provided as a matrix or a data frame. The column names in the distance data are assumed to be orig, dest, and dist. Just like with migration flows, you can customize the column names using the appropriate arguments. It is important to note that the origin and destination names in both the migration data and the distance data must match for accurate calculations. In cases where within-region migration moves are present in the data, the index_distance() function will automatically exclude them from the distance calculations. To demonstrate we will use migration data on internal migration between first-level administrative districts in South Korea provide in the korea_reg data frame in the migest. The data covers migration flows between 2012 and 2020 and was published by the Korean Statistical Information Service (KOSIS) at https://kosis.kr/eng. # 2020 migration data kor_mig_2020 &lt;- korea_reg %&gt;% filter(year == 2020) # check no differences in names used in migration and distance data sets symdiff(x = unique(kor_mig_2020$orig), y = kor_pw$Adm_N) ## character(0) index_distance(m = kor_mig_2020, d = kor_dist_pw) ## # A tibble: 3 × 2 ## measure value ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 mean 105. ## 2 median 68.7 ## 3 decay -0.852 4.3 Migration connectivity The size of migration flows between different migration corridors is influenced by various factors beyond population sizes and distances. These flows also reflect the strength of historical, cultural, social, and economic ties between regions. For example, regions with stronger connections may experience higher migration flows due to shared history, language, or economic opportunities. Bell et al. (2002) note a fragmentation in the literature on the measurement of connections within a migration system, leading to the use of different terms such as spatial connectivity, spatial concentration, spatial inequality, and spatial focusing, among others. These terms highlight the diverse aspects of migration connections and the different perspectives from which they have be studied. To explore and analyze migration connectivity, there are numerous indices available. The migration.indices package, for instance, provides a range of indices that capture different dimensions of migration connectivity. The various connectivity measures can be broadly categorized into five groups: connectivity, inequity, Gini coefficients, spatial focusing, and coefficient of variation. These measures capture different aspects of the overall concentration of migration flows in a system, whilst two of the measures also offer extended perspectives on the concentration in-migration and out-migration flow totals. Connectivity measures assess the number of connections between regions. Inequity measures examine the distribution of migration flows across regions, in comparisons to expected migration flows under different assumptions. Gini coefficients, commonly used in economic inequality analysis, can also be applied to migration data to measure the concentration or dispersion of migration flows among regions. Spatial focusing measures identify the extent to which migration is concentrated or dispersed, indicating the level of spatial clustering or scattering of migrants across regions. Coefficient of variation measures the variability or diversity of migration flows across regions, providing insights into the heterogeneity of migration patterns. The index_connectivity() function in the migest package offers 11 different measures that capture various aspects of migration connectivity from these five groups. To calculate the measures, a user can provide a matrix or data frame containing the migration flows as input to the function. If using a data frame, the function assumes that the flows are specified in a column with the name “flow.” However, if your data frame uses a different column name for the flows, you can specify it using the “flow_col” argument. index_connectivity(m = kor_mig_2020) ## # A tibble: 11 × 2 ## measure value ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 connectivity 1 ## 2 inequality_equal 0.541 ## 3 inequality_sim 0.281 ## 4 gini_total 0.709 ## 5 gini_orig_standardized 0.0493 ## 6 gini_dest_standardized 0.0517 ## 7 mwg_orig 0.0370 ## 8 mwg_dest 0.0389 ## 9 mwg_mean 0.0379 ## 10 cv 17.9 ## 11 acv 3.43 In the following subsection we discuss in more detail each of these measures in more detail 4.3.1 Connectivity The simplest connectivity (connectivity in the output above) evaluates the proportion of non-zero migration flows, excluding within-region flows. This measure is particularly useful when dealing with regions where populations are relatively smaller, which is more common when there are many administrative units. For the South Korea data used above, all migration corridors had non-zero migration flows during 2020 4.3.2 Inequality The inequality measures discussed by Bell (2002) are based on the distribution of observed flows compared to the expected distribution. The inequality_equal measure quantifies the distance between the observed flows and an expected distribution where all flows are equal. The inequality_sim measure quantifies the distance between the observed flows and an expected distribution derived from a spatial interaction model, such as a Poisson regression model for an independence fit. \\[ \\widehat{\\log(m_{ij})} = \\beta_0 + \\beta_{1i} \\texttt{origin} + \\beta_{2j} \\texttt{destination} \\] Both inequality measures range from 0 to 1, where a value of 0 indicates that the observed flows match the expected values, suggesting some form of equality, while a value of 1 represents the maximum distance between the observed flows and the expected flows, indicating maximum inequality in the distribution of migration flows. 4.3.3 Gini measures The Gini migration measures provide insights into the spatial focusing of a migration system, assessing the extent to which migration flows are concentrated in specific corridors compared to others. They are calculated by comparing each flow in the migration matrix with every other flow to determine the degree of spatial focusing. The gini_total measure quantifies the overall spatial focusing in the migration flows. A value of zero indicates an equal distribution of flows across all corridors, indicating no spatial focusing. On the other hand, a value of 1 indicates maximum spatial focusing, where migration is concentrated in a single corridor. In addition to the gini_total measure, the gini_orig_standardized and gini_dest_standardized values provide insights into the spatial focusing from the perspectives of origin and destination regions, respectively. These measures compare the outflows from each origin region or the inflows to each destination region, respectively, to assess the spatial concentration of the migration patterns. The standardized values ensure that the range of these measures is between 0 and 1, with zero indicating no spatial focusing. 4.3.4 Spatial Focusing The migration weighted Gini indexes specifically mwg_orig and mwg_dest, offer measures of focusing for the total in-migration and out-migration, respectively. , Also proposed by Bell et al. (2002), these indexes assess the degree to which migration flows are concentrated in specific origins or destinations. A value of zero indicates no spatial focusing, while a value of 1 suggests that all migration flows pass through a single origin or destination. Additionally, the mwg_mean measure provides a system-wide measure of focusing for all migration totals. It is calculated as a simple average of mwg_orig and mwg_dest. Similar to the other Gini measures, the mwg_mean value ranges between zero and 1, with zero indicating no spatial focusing and 1 indicating a high concentration of migration in a single origin or destination. 4.3.5 Coefficient of Variation The coefficient of variation (cv in the output from the index_connectivity() function above), as proposed by Rogers and Raymer (1998), is a measure provided by the function that compares the mean of migration flows to the standard deviation of those flows. Unlike some of the previous measures, the coefficient of variation is not limited to a range of 0 to 1. It provides a quantitative measure of the variability in migration flows, where a higher coefficient of variation indicates greater dispersion or inequality in the flows. In addition to the coefficient of variation, the aggregated system-wide coefficient of variation Rogers and Raymer (1998) calculates a similar measure of variation but based on the aggregate coefficient of variations of in-migration and out-migration totals. It takes into account the means and standard deviations of the total in-migration and out-migration flows. Similar to the cv measure, the acv (in the output from the index_connectivity() function above) is not restricted to a range of 0 to 1. It is particularly useful for making comparisons across different time periods or countries, as a rising coefficient of variation would indicate increasing inequality in migration flows or flow totals. 4.4 Migration impact Measures fro the impact of migration assesses the degree to which migration contributes to the transformation of human settlement patterns. In many regions around the world, migration has become or is becoming the predominant mechanism driving population redistribution. Descriptive studies often concentrate on examining net migration counts at the regional level, which reveal the direction and magnitude of population changes. However, as noted before, changes in migration volumes and may not always be revealed in net migration counts. Additional measures exist to provide a more comprehensive summary of the overall effect of migration in redistributing populations across the entire system of regions. These measures take into account not only the net migration figures but also the gross migration flows between regions. By considering the complete migration picture, these measures offer insights into the broader impact of migration on population redistribution. 4.4.1 Migration effectiveness index The migration effectiveness index (MEI), introduced by Shryock and Siegel (1976), evaluates the asymmetry or equilibrium in a migration network by comparing the sum of net migration to the migration turnover. The MEI is calculated by taking the absolute sum of net migration and dividing it by the sum of migration turnover, multiplied by 100. \\[ \\texttt{MEI} = 100 \\frac{\\sum_{i} | \\texttt{net} |}{\\sum_{i} \\texttt{turnover}_i} = 100 \\frac{\\sum_{i} | m_{+i} - m_{i+}|}{\\sum_{i} m_{+i} + m_{i+}} \\] The MEI ranges between 0 and 100. Higher values of the MEI indicate that migration is an efficient mechanism for population redistribution, as reflected by large net migration totals relative to the overall turnover. In other words, a higher MEI suggests that migration plays a significant role in reshaping the population distribution within the network. Conversely, values closer to zero are generated from more balanced migration systems with less pronounced population redistribution. A lower MEI indicates a relatively equitable distribution of migration flows, where the net migration values are smaller in relation to the turnover. 4.4.2 Aggregate net migration rate The aggregate net migration rate (ANMR), proposed by Bell et al. (2002), captures the overall effect of migration on population settlement patterns. It is derived from the migration net totals and the populations of regions within a country. The ANMR replaces the denominator of the MEI formula with the population of each region, denoted as \\(P_i\\). \\[ \\texttt{ANMR} = 100 \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\sum_{i} |\\texttt{net}_i|}{\\sum_{i} P_i} = 100 \\frac{1}{2} \\frac{\\sum_{i} | m_{+i} - m_{i+} |}{\\sum_{i} P_i} \\] The ANMR represents the net shift of population between regions per 100 residents in the country. Unlike the MEI, which uses migration turnover in the denominator, the ANMR utilizes the population of each region. This allows for a measurement of the net migration effect relative to the size of the population in each region. The ANMR has no upper limit, as it depends on the net migration values and the population sizes of the regions. A higher ANMR indicates a larger net shift of population between regions, relative to the overall population size in the country. It reflects the magnitude of population redistribution resulting from migration. Additionally, the ANMR can be seen as the product of the migration connectivity index (CMI) and the migration effectiveness index (MEI). It combines the measures of connectivity and effectiveness to provide an overall assessment of the impact of migration on population settlement patterns. 4.4.3 Preference and velocity The manual by the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs Population Division (1970) introduces two other impact measures for migration, although these measures have become less commonly used in recent years. The preference index is derived from an expected model of migration interactions based on population shares and the overall level of migration. It compares the observed migration flows (\\(m_{ij}\\)) to an expected model where migration rates in all populations are the same. \\[ \\texttt{preference} = \\sum_{ij}{\\frac{m_{ij}}{m_{++} \\frac{p_{i}}{p_+}\\frac{p_{j}}{p_+}}} \\] where \\(m_{++}\\) is the total migration flow, \\(p_{+}\\) is the sum of populations in each region, and \\(p_i\\) and \\(p_j\\) are the population sizes of the origin and destination regions, respectively. The preference index measures the extent to which the observed flows deviate from the expected flows based on population shares and overall migration levels. There is no upper limit to the preference index. The velocity index, on the other hand, is based on a migration velocity measure (\\(\\frac{m_{ij}}{p_{i} p_{j}}\\)) multiplied by the total population and summed over all migration flows. It compares the observed flows to an expected model where flow sizes are determined solely by the population sizes of the origin and destination regions. \\[ \\texttt{velocity} = \\sum_{ij}{\\frac{m_{ij}}{p_{i} p_{j}}{p_+}} \\] Similar to the preference index, the velocity index has no upper limit. Both the preference index and the velocity index provide measures of the deviation of observed migration flows from the expected patterns based on population sizes and overall migration levels. They offer alternative perspectives on the impact of migration on population redistribution, focusing on the relative significance of observed flows compared to expectations based on population factors alone. 4.4.4 Migration Impact Measures in R The index_impact() function in the migest package allows for the calculation of all four impact measures: preference index, velocity index, migration effectiveness index (MEI), and aggregate net migration rate (ANMR). This function requires a set of migration flows and population sizes in each region. As with the previous index functions in the migest package, the migration flows can be provided as a matrix or a data frame. The function assumes that the column names for the regions and population values provided to the p argument are region and pop, respectively, in a data frame. If your data frame has different column names, you can specify them using the reg_col and pop_col parameters. In the code below we use the population estimates from the WorldPop group provided in the Pop column of the kor_pw ojbect created earlier. index_impact(m = kor_mig_2020, p = kor_pw, pop_col = &quot;Pop&quot;, reg_col = &quot;Adm_N&quot;) ## # A tibble: 4 × 2 ## measure value ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 effectivness 7.67 ## 2 anmr 0.379 ## 3 preference 916. ## 4 velocity 45.3 4.5 Applying index functions multiple times Some of the summary measures discussed above are meaningless on their own, as they have no relative scale and have been calculated in isolation. However, the index functions can be applied to compare migration systems across different areas or time periods relatively easily using R, enabling comparative analyses. To apply the index functions multiple times, you can loop over the countries or time periods of interest and apply the functions within the loop. Alternatively, you can use vectorized operations or apply functions from the dplyr or purrr packages to handle multiple countries or time periods efficiently. To demonstrate the application of the index functions in the migest package, we can use the korea_reg data of internal migration flows between 2012 and 2020 in South Korea. First we use the group_nest() function from the dplyr package which transforms the data frame into a grouped data frame based on the year column, which is a necessary step for applying the index functions. Once the data is grouped, we can then apply the index_connectivity() function to each row using the map() function from the purrr package. This will calculate the connectivity measures for each year in the korea_reg data set. We may set long = FALSE within the index_connectivity() function to allow for separate columns for each measure. These can be viewed over time using the unnest() function in the tidyr package d &lt;- korea_reg %&gt;% filter(orig != dest) %&gt;% group_nest(year, .key = &quot;mig_data&quot;) %&gt;% mutate(connectivity = map(.x = mig_data, .f = ~index_connectivity(.x, long = FALSE))) d ## # A tibble: 9 × 3 ## year mig_data connectivity ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;list&lt;tibble[,3]&gt;&gt; &lt;list&gt; ## 1 2012 [272 × 3] &lt;tibble [1 × 11]&gt; ## 2 2013 [272 × 3] &lt;tibble [1 × 11]&gt; ## 3 2014 [272 × 3] &lt;tibble [1 × 11]&gt; ## 4 2015 [272 × 3] &lt;tibble [1 × 11]&gt; ## 5 2016 [272 × 3] &lt;tibble [1 × 11]&gt; ## 6 2017 [272 × 3] &lt;tibble [1 × 11]&gt; ## 7 2018 [272 × 3] &lt;tibble [1 × 11]&gt; ## 8 2019 [272 × 3] &lt;tibble [1 × 11]&gt; ## 9 2020 [272 × 3] &lt;tibble [1 × 11]&gt; d %&gt;% unnest(connectivity) ## # A tibble: 9 × 13 ## year mig_data conne…¹ inequ…² inequ…³ gini_…⁴ gini_…⁵ gini_…⁶ mwg_o…⁷ ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;list&lt;tibble[,3&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 2012 [272 × 3] 1 0.554 0.266 0.718 0.0500 0.0498 0.0380 ## 2 2013 [272 × 3] 1 0.552 0.270 0.717 0.0501 0.0499 0.0381 ## 3 2014 [272 × 3] 1 0.542 0.282 0.707 0.0507 0.0495 0.0380 ## 4 2015 [272 × 3] 1 0.537 0.284 0.703 0.0509 0.0496 0.0378 ## 5 2016 [272 × 3] 1 0.541 0.277 0.707 0.0505 0.0502 0.0376 ## 6 2017 [272 × 3] 1 0.538 0.285 0.703 0.0502 0.0506 0.0374 ## 7 2018 [272 × 3] 1 0.541 0.281 0.707 0.0497 0.0511 0.0370 ## 8 2019 [272 × 3] 1 0.537 0.280 0.703 0.0493 0.0514 0.0366 ## 9 2020 [272 × 3] 1 0.541 0.281 0.709 0.0493 0.0517 0.0370 ## # … with 4 more variables: mwg_dest &lt;dbl&gt;, mwg_mean &lt;dbl&gt;, cv &lt;dbl&gt;, acv &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # and abbreviated variable names ¹​connectivity, ²​inequality_equal, ## # ³​inequality_sim, ⁴​gini_total, ⁵​gini_orig_standardized, ## # ⁶​gini_dest_standardized, ⁷​mwg_orig This approach allows for easy comparison and analysis of migration systems between different areas or time periods. For example, we can see that connectivity measures such as the inequality_equal and gini_total showed a decreases after initial higher values during 2012 and 2013 in the proceeding seven years from 2014 to 2020. We can use similar code to calculate the distance indices d &lt;- d %&gt;% mutate(distance = map(.x = mig_data, .f = ~index_distance(m = .x, d = kor_dist_pw, long = FALSE))) d %&gt;% select(year, distance) %&gt;% unnest(distance) ## # A tibble: 9 × 4 ## year mean median decay ## &lt;int&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 2012 108. 76 -0.784 ## 2 2013 107. 76 -0.795 ## 3 2014 108. 76 -0.816 ## 4 2015 108. 76 -0.828 ## 5 2016 107. 76 -0.820 ## 6 2017 108. 75.8 -0.839 ## 7 2018 107. 74.8 -0.839 ## 8 2019 107. 75.8 -0.836 ## 9 2020 105. 68.7 -0.852 The measures illustrate a decline in the mean and median distances over the nine years, whilst the distance decay parameter increases - again implying declining shorter migration distances. The impact and intensity measures require additional data on populatino sizes, which are provided in the korea_pop data frame in the migest package.
