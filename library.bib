abstract = {We develop a new dataset using UNESCO source materials on the location of nearly 15,000 universities in about 1,500 regions across 78 countries, some dating back to the 11th Century. We estimate fixed effects models at the sub-national level between 1950 and 2010 and find that increases in the number of universities are positively associated with future growth of GDP per capita (and this relationship is robust to controlling for a host of observables, as well as unobserved regional trends). Our estimates imply that a 10{\%} increase in a region's number of universities per capita is associated with 0.4{\%} higher future GDP per capita in that region. Furthermore, there appear to be positive spillover effects from universities to geographically close neighbouring regions. We show that the relationship between GDP per capita and universities is not simply driven by the direct expenditures of the university, its staff and students. Part of the effect of universities on growth is mediated through an increased supply of human capital and greater innovation. Furthermore, we find that within countries, higher historical university presence is associated with stronger pro-democratic attitudes.},

abstract = {The projected size and spatial distribution of the future population are important drivers of global change and key determinants of exposure and vulnerability to hazards. Spatial demographic projections are widely used as inputs to spatial projections of land use, energy use, and emissions, as well as to assessments of the impacts of extreme events, sea level rise, and other climate-related outcomes. To date, however, there are very few global-scale, spatially explicit population projections, and those that do exist are often based on simple scaling or trend extrapolation. Here we present a new set of global, spatially explicit population scenarios that are consistent with the new Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) developed to facilitate global change research. We use a parameterized gravity-based downscaling model to produce projections of spatial population change that are quantitatively consistent with national population and urbanization projections for the SSPs and qualitatively consistent with assumptions in the SSP narratives regarding spatial development patterns. We show that the five SSPs lead to substantially different spatial population outcomes at the continental, national, and sub-national scale. In general, grid cell-level outcomes are most influenced by national-level population change, second by urbanization rate, and third by assumptions about the spatial style of development. However, the relative importance of these factors is a function of the magnitude of the projected change in total population and urbanization for each country and across SSPs. We also demonstrate variation in outcomes considering the example of population existing in a low-elevation coastal zone under alternative scenarios.},

abstract = {The paper reviews techniques developed in demography, geography and statistics that are useful for bridging the gap between available data on international migration flows and the information required for policy making and research. The basic idea of the paper is as follows: to establish a coherent and consistent data base that contains sufficiently detailed, up-to-date and accurate information, data from several sources should be combined. That raises issues of definition and measurement, and of how to combine data from different origins properly. The issues may be tackled more easily if the statistics that are being compiled are viewed as different outcomes or manifestations of underlying stochastic processes governing migration. The link between the processes and their outcomes is described by models, the parameters of which must be estimated from the available data. That may be done within the context of socio-demographic accounting. The paper discusses the experience of the U.S. Bureau of the Census in combining migration data from several sources. It also summarizes the many efforts in Europe to establish a coherent and consistent data base on international migration.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Inter-provincial migration causes dramatic changes in the population, as well as in the development of the social economy at both origin and destination, which is related to sustainable development in any country. Using inter-provincial migration data during the periods covering 1995–2000, 2000–2005, 2005–2010, and 2010–2015, we analyze the migration volume, intensity and flow, as well as its changes over time. We also examine the determinants associated with migration by applying Poisson pseudo-maximum-likelihood (PPML) estimation techniques. The results show that migrants move mainly from inland to coastal areas; however, since 2010, the number of migrants moving from coastal to inland areas has shown a continuous increase. This inter-provincial migration was driven largely by the influence of economic factors, such as high urban income per capita. A better model for the period of 2010–2015 is established by adopting an extended set of variables. New variables that represent regional disparities and industrial upgrades have a positive impact on inter-provincial migration, which shows that regional economic disparities and economic restructuring have played an important role in migration in recent years.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Climate change is increasingly been called a 'security' problem, and there has been speculation that climate change may increase the risk of violent conflict. This paper integrates three disparate but well-founded bodies of research - on the vulnerability of local places and social groups to climate change, on livelihoods and violent conflict, and the role of the state in development and peacemaking, to offer new insights into the relationships between climate change, human security, and violent conflict. It explains that climate change increasingly undermines human security in the present day, and will increasingly do so in the future, by reducing access to, and the quality of, natural resources that are important to sustain livelihoods. Climate change is also likely to undermine the capacity of states to provide the opportunities and services that help people to sustain their livelihoods. We argue that in certain circumstances these direct and indirect impacts of climate change on human security may in turn increase the risk of violent conflict. The paper then outlines the broad contours of a research programme to guide empirical investigations into the risks climate change poses to human security and peace. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Abstract Immigration and asylum are key political issues in Britain and the European Union. Yet the policies of states and supranational bodies seem to have had little success in preventing unwanted flows and effectively managing immigration and integration. This article examines three types of reasons for policy failure: factors arising from the social dynamics of the migratory process; factors linked to globalization and the North-South divide; and factors arising within political systems. Key issues include the role of migrant agency, the way the North-South divide encourages flows, and hidden agendas in national policies. EU efforts attempts to address the root causes of migration in countries of origin are discussed. The article concludes that migration policies might be more successful if they were explicitly linked to long-term political agendas concerned with trade, development and conflict prevention. Reducing North-South inequality is the real key to effective migration management.},

abstract = {Migration flows are shaped by a complex combination of self-selection and out-selection mechanisms, both of which are affected by the presence of a diaspora abroad. In this paper, we analyze how existing diasporas (the stock of people born in a country and living in another one) affect the size and human-capital structure of current bilateral migration flows. Our analysis exploits a bilateral data set on international migration by educational attainment from 195 countries to 30 OECD countries in 1990 and 2000. Based on simple micro-foundations and controlling for various determinants of migration, we found that diasporas increase migration flows and lower their average educational level. Interestingly, diasporas explain majority of the variability of migration flows and selection. This suggests that, without changing the generosity of family reunion programs, education-based selection rules are likely to have moderate impact. Our results are highly robust to the econometric techniques, accounting for the large proportion of zeros and endogeneity problems. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Understanding the causes and effects of internal migration is critical to the effective design and implementation of policies that promote human development. However, a major impediment to deepening this understanding is the lack of reliable data on the movement of individuals within a country. Government censuses and household surveys, from which most migration statistics are derived, are difficult to coordinate and costly to implement, and typically do not capture the patterns of temporary and circular migration that are prevalent in developing economies. In this paper, we describe how new information and communications technologies (ICTs), and mobile phones in particular, can provide a new source of data on internal migration. As these technologies quickly proliferate throughout the developing world, billions of individuals are now carrying devices from which it is possible to reconstruct detailed trajectories through time and space. Using Rwanda as a case study, we demonstrate how such data can be use...},

abstract = {Projections of the ethnic composition of the UK population presage radical change in the future at both national and local levels. The first question that users of such population projections ask is ‘what is driving the results?' The answer can be found in the assumptions made for future mortality rates, future fertility rates, future migration rates and flows, and the age–sex structure of the starting populations. But it is difficult to disentangle the component effects and demographic momentum. We adapt a methodology proposed and used by Bongaarts and Bulatao in 1999 (Population and Development Review 25 515–29) by extending to national, subnational and ethnic group projections, applying it to projections of the ethnic group populations in English local authorities. We assess the roles played by immigration assumptions (the subject of continuous public debate), fertility assumptions, mortality assumptions and internal migration assumptions together with the role of the existing population age structure of each group in each area. Our findings are that positive immigration assumptions contribute to population growth in all local authorities, below replacement fertility lowers the population everywhere, declining mortality compensates for missing babies but substitutes elders and internal migration has very different effects depending on the local authority. Ethnic groups vary enormously in terms of the contribution of the current age structure. The demographic momentum of the White groups produces population declines while it is the most important demographic driver for some but not all of minority ethnic groups. The paper reports on the methods, assumptions and results associated with a systematic set of ‘what if' projections. These enable us to determine the demographic drivers of future ethnic population change for England's local areas over the time horizon 2001–2051.},

abstract = {Population forecasts entail a significant amount of uncertainty, especially for long-range horizons and for places with small or rapidly changing populations. This uncertainty can be dealt with by presenting a range of projections or by developing statistical prediction intervals. The latter can be based on models that incorporate the stochastic nature of the forecasting process, on empirical analyses of past forecast errors, or on a combination of the two. In this article, we develop and test prediction intervals based on empirical analyses of past forecast errors for counties in the United States. Using decennial census data from 1900 to 2000, we apply trend extrapolation techniques to develop a set of county population forecasts; calculate forecast errors by comparing forecasts to subsequent census counts; and use the distribution of errors to construct empirical prediction intervals. We find that empirically-based prediction intervals provide reasonably accurate predictions of the precision of population forecasts, but provide little guidance regarding their tendency to be too high or too low. We believe the construction of empirically-based prediction intervals will help users of small-area population forecasts measure and evaluate the uncertainty inherent in population forecasts and plan more effectively for the future.},

abstract = {Most previous studies of migration are premised on a one-period model in which the person has a single opportunity to decide to migrate or not, and to select a destination. Yet the demographic literature has long noted that most moves are not people's first moves, but rather are repeated moves -- either onward to new locations or back to places where they lived before (return moves). This paper focuses on repeat moves and inquires into how previous migrants choose among moving on to a new location, returning to a previous location, and staying put. To explain this choice, we broaden the human capital model of migration to incorporate the concepts of location-specific capital and infromation costs. We then test this reformulated model using longitudinal micro data. We find that whereas migration to new locations conforms with previously established relationships, return migration soon after an initial move sometimes contradicts those relationships.},

To investigate this challenging task, we analyzed 13 millions Twitter posts (3 GB) of data in New York. Then we test upon this data a probabilistic topic models approach to automatically extract urban patterns from location-based social network data.

This study aims to expand on previous research by investigating how ethical leadership cultivates healthy Chinese guanxi between employees and their supervisors and influences employee organizational citizenship behavior (OCB). We propose that two types of Chinese guanxi, favor-seeking guanxi and rent-seeking guanxi, may play a mediating role in the relationship between ethical leadership and OCB. Using survey data collected from Chinese employees (N = 502), regression and bootstrap analyses are used to test the proposed research model. The results suggest that ethical leadership not only directly promotes employee OCB performance, but also does so indirectly by facilitating favor-seeking guanxi orientation and suppressing rent-seeking guanxi orientation. The results provide a theoretical contribution to the study of ethical leadership and Chinese guanxi, and also extend our practical understanding of the role of ethical leadership in enhancing OCB effectively in the China context. Key points 1 Chinese guanxi has an important role in mediating between ethical leadership and employee OCB. 2 Ethical leadership directly promotes employee OCB. 3 Ethical leadership also indirectly promotes employee OCB by facilitating favor-seeking guanxi and suppressing rent-seeking guanxi.

Here we outline approaches to developing a new high resolution population distribution dataset for Africa and analyse rural accessibility to population centers. Contemporary population count data were combined with detailed satellite-derived settlement extents to map population distributions across Africa at a finer spatial resolution than ever before. Substantial heterogeneity in settlement patterns, population concentration and spatial accessibility to major population centres is exhibited across the continent. In Africa, 90{\%} of the population is concentrated in less than 21{\%} of the land surface and the average per-person travel time to settlements of more than 50,000 inhabitants is around 3.5 hours, with Central and East Africa displaying the longest average travel times. The analyses highlight large inequities in access, the isolation of many rural populations and the challenges that exist between countries and regions in providing access to services.

Given that these migrations may obscure the natural demographic structure of nations, they are likely to explain a significant part of global imbalances. This paper tackles this issue by investigating the role played by international migration in the dynamics of global imbalances. To this end, we rely on an overlapping generations model to derive the theoretical relationship between international migration and current account position. Through a series of robust estimates, we empirically investigate this relationship by relying on a panel of 157 developed and developing countries over the period 1990-2014. Our results point to substantial effects of international migration. Specifically, we show that an increase in migration improves national savings and the current account balance in the destination country, while it has opposite impacts in the origin country. These effects are particularly pronounced in developing economies, and attenuated by migrants' remittances.},

abstract = {Trade plays a key role in the spread of alien species and has arguably contributed to the recent enormous acceleration of biological invasions, thus homogenizing biotas worldwide. Combining data on 60-year trends of bilateral trade, as well as on biodiversity and climate, we modeled the global spread of plant species among 147 countries. The model results were compared with a recently compiled unique global data set on numbers of naturalized alien vascular plant species representing the most comprehensive collection of naturalized plant distributions currently available. The model identifies major source regions, introduction routes, and hot spots of plant invasions that agree well with observed naturalized plant numbers. In contrast to common knowledge, we show that the 'imperialist dogma,' stating that Europe has been a net exporter of naturalized plants since colonial times, does not hold for the past 60 years, when more naturalized plants were being imported to than exported from Europe. Our results highlight that the current distribution of naturalized plants is best predicted by socioeconomic activities 20 years ago. We took advantage of the observed time lag and used trade developments until recent times to predict naturalized plant trajectories for the next two decades. This shows that particularly strong increases in naturalized plant numbers are expected in the next 20 years for emerging economies in megadiverse regions. The interaction with predicted future climate change will increase invasions in northern temperate countries and reduce them in tropical and (sub)tropical regions, yet not by enough to cancel out the trade-related increase.},

In this paper {\textless}i{\textgreater}ex ante{\textless}/i{\textgreater} projections from simple models are used to evaluate the plausibility of point and interval forecasts from a complex cohort-component model. This paper compares complex with simple forecasts along two dimensions: simplification of input schedules and of the projection models using those input schedules. Projections of vital rates that are the inputs for a cohort-component projection may be provided by extrapolations of historical trends in age-specific rates, relational methods that link future age-specific rates {\textless}i{\textgreater}to{\textless}/i{\textgreater} a general trend variable and a {\^{A}}“standard{\^{A}}”; schedule, or time series forecasts of the parameters of a functionally specified model schedule. This paper compares point and interval forecasts of fertility patterns that result from such alternative input specifications. Furthermore, the cohort-component framework may be replaced by an aggregated model for population forecasting, for example, by a time series model of total population growth. This paper uses the point and interval forecasts from such an aggregate time series model to establish the plausibility of the complex cohort-component projection.},

abstract = {Inadequate and inconsistent data are a common and persistent problem
in the field of migration. Deficiencies in migration statistics may
be tackled using modelling techniques, which has recently been recognised
by the European Union (EU) policymakers. The new Regulation on Community
statistics on international migration, which obliges countries to
supply harmonised statistics, provides for the possibility of using
estimation methods to adapt statistics based on national definitions
to comply with the required 1-year duration of stay definition. The
main objective of this paper is to provide a theoretical probabilistic
framework to capture various migration flow statistics that are available.
It is a crucial step towards better understanding and then harmonising
the data. Different migration measures represent the same continuous
data-generating process. They differ depending on how the data happened
to be collected and how the statistics happened to be produced. We
introduce the key concepts of migration statistics using a simple
duration model, namely an exponential distribution. While more complex
models can better reflect the reality, they do not fundamentally
modify the framework presented. The main focus is put on the time
criterion used in the migration definition. It refers to the duration
of stay following relocation, which is specified very differently
among countries and constitutes the main source of discrepancies
in operationalisation of the migration concept in the EU member states.

abstract = {In response to the recent migrant and refugee crisis, rich countries have redoubled policy efforts to deter future immigration from poor countries by addressing the “root causes” of migration. We review existing evidence on the effectiveness of such efforts. First, aid disbursements do not generally follow “root causes” rhetoric. The sectoral distribution of aid to migrant-origin countries does not significantly differ from its distribution in other countries. Second, the evidence suggests that aid's capacity to deter migration is small at best. Aid can only encourage economic growth, employment, and security to a limited degree. Beyond this, successful development in almost all formerly-poor countries has produced an increase in emigration. Third, this evidence implies that donors could achieve greater impact by leveraging foreign aid not to deter migration but to shape it for mutual benefit.},

abstract = {The projected size and spatial distribution of the future population are important drivers of global change and key determinants of exposure and vulnerability to hazards. Spatial demographic projections are widely used as inputs to spatial projections of land use, energy use, and emissions, as well as to assessments of the impacts of extreme events, sea level rise, and other climate-related outcomes. To date, however, there are very few global-scale, spatially explicit population projections, and those that do exist are often based on simple scaling or trend extrapolation. Here we present a new set of global, spatially explicit population scenarios that are consistent with the new Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) developed to facilitate global change research. We use a parameterized gravity-based downscaling model to produce projections of spatial population change that are quantitatively consistent with national population and urbanization projections for the SSPs and qualitatively consistent with assumptions in the SSP narratives regarding spatial development patterns. We show that the five SSPs lead to substantially different spatial population outcomes at the continental, national, and sub-national scale. In general, grid cell-level outcomes are most influenced by national-level population change, second by urbanization rate, and third by assumptions about the spatial style of development. However, the relative importance of these factors is a function of the magnitude of the projected change in total population and urbanization for each country and across SSPs. We also demonstrate variation in outcomes considering the example of population existing in a low-elevation coastal zone under alternative scenarios.},

Current state-of-the-art estimates of bilateral migration flows rely on the assumption that the number of global migrants is as small as possible. We relax this assumption, producing complete estimates of all between-country migration flows with genuine estimates of total global migration. We find that the total number of individuals migrating internationally has oscillated between 1.13 and 1.29{\%} of the global population per 5-year period since 1990. Return migration and transit migration are big parts of total migration; roughly one of four migration events is a return to an individual's country of birth. In the most recent time period, we estimate particularly large return migration flows from the United States to Central and South America and from the Persian Gulf to south Asia.},

abstract = {The variability of demographic trends at the subnational scale, particularly
internal and international migration, renders subnational population
forecasting more difficult than at the national scale. Illustrating
the uncertainty of the demographic future for subnational regions
is therefore a crucial element of any set of subnational population
forecasts. However, subnational forecasts are currently prepared
using deterministic models, which fail to properly address the issue
of demographic uncertainty. The traditional high, medium, and low
variants approach employed by many national statistical offices poses
a number of problems. Probabilistic population forecasting models
have the potential to overcome many of these problems, but these
models have so far been limited to national-level forecasts. This
article reports a first attempt to implement a probabilistic approach
to subnational population forecasting using a biregional projection
framework. The article sets out the forecasting framework, outlines
the approach adopted to formulate each of the assumptions, and presents
probabilistic forecasts for 2002{\^{a}}€“2051 for Queensland and the rest
of Australia. The forecasts show a two-thirds probability that Queensland's
population in 2051 will be between 5.4 and 7.7 million while the
same range for the rest of the country is 18.6 and 22.7 million.
The forecasts quantify to what extent greater uncertainty exists
about the demographic future at the subnational compared with the
national scale.},

In modelling problems where data are missing, the predicted values for the missing observations are frequently of interest. To assist in the identification of cases that substantially affect these predicted values, we introduce a case deletion diagnostic which is often conveniently evaluated in the setting of the EM algorithm. Our diagnostic is defined as the Kullback-Leibler information between two versions of the conditional density of the missing data given the observed data: one based on the parameter estimates arising from the full data set; the other based on the parameter estimates arising from the case-deleted data set. We outline the computation of the diagnostic for two Gaussian frameworks: for bivariate data applications in which some of the data pairs are incomplete, and for time series forecasting applications in which the missing observations are future realizations of the series. Our analyses involve bivariate data from the 1998 American Major League Baseball season and a time series consisting of cardiovascular mortality readings from the Los Angeles area.},

In the present study, we explore the stress- coping-adjustment model and its role in acculturation for educational sojourners in the People's Republic of China. Using a sample of 121 recent exchange students (Asian, n = 52; non-Asian, n = 69), we administered surveys in the Fall of 2013 and 90 days later to measure students' socio-cultural adaptation. Results indicate several significant find- ings. Acculturative stress and perceived cultural distance had no role in predicting adaptation. Non-Asians reported greater adjustment even though cultural distance was greater. As hypothesized, non-Asians used more primary and secondary coping compared to Asians. Moderation analyses indicate three-way interactions among stress × cop- ing × group, showing that non-Asians benefit from high usage primary coping, while primary coping exacerbates the negative effects of stress on adjustment for Asians. Secondary coping proves to be beneficial for both groups and improves adjustment across low and moderate stress levels. Results support recent developments in collective cop- ing, suggesting that primary and secondary coping may not be beneficial for all ethnic groups in all circumstances. Research implications and practical contributions are discussed.},

Many countries do not publish data on bilateral migration flows. At least six methods have been proposed recently to estimate bilateral migration flows between all origin-destination country pairs based on migrant stock data published by the World Bank and United Nations. We apply each of these methods to the latest available stock data to provide six estimates of five-year bilateral migration flows between 1990 and 2015. To assess the resulting estimates, we correlate estimates of six migration measures from each method with equivalent reported data where possible. Such systematic efforts at validation have largely been neglected thus far. We show that the correlation between the reported data and the estimates varies widely among different migration measures, over space, and over time. We find that the two methods using a closed demographic accounting approach perform consistently better than the four other estimation approaches.},

They present the findings of research on European residents who have reached or are on the threshold of old age and whose current circumstances have been stronly influenced by a migration across an international border. Such 'older migrants' are scattered throughout Europe and they have especially diverse characteristics. They include some of the most deprived and socially excluded, and some of the most affluent and accomplished, but all to a greater or lesser extent are disadvantaged through an interaction between social policies and their 'otherness' by living in a foreign country. Some claim attention through the severity of their unmet health and welfare needs and poor capacity to access advice and treatment, while the affluent groups are of great interest to social gerontology because of their enterprising, developmental and positive approaches to old age. They include among the most innovative of the latest generation of older people, who prusue new combinations of family responsibilities, leisure pursuits and income generation. The paper proposes that the concept 'human capital' summarises variations in preparedness for old age, that is, the resources by which people cope with demands for income, roles, treatment, care and support. A typology of the 'welfare position' of international migrants in contemporary Europe is presented. {\textcopyright} 2004 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract = {This paper develops a simple time series model of emigration and
applies it to data for emigration from the United Kingdom, 1870-1913.
The model is derived from a microeconomic analysis of the migration
decision and provides a specific functional form and dynamic structure.
It encompasses and explains many of the empirical findings of earlier
research on the determinants of emigration over this historical period.
The results support the model strongly in most respects. Both wage
rates and employment rates in the sending and in the receiving countries
influenced fluctuations in emigration. The short-run fluctuations
were driven largely by variations in employment rates while the long-run
level of emigration was determined largely by the relative wage.},

@article{Poot2016,
abstract = {For at least half a century, and building on observations first made a century earlier, the gravity model has been the most commonly-used paradigm for understanding gross migration flows between regions. This model owes its suc-cess to, firstly, its intuitive consistency with migration theories; secondly, ease of estimation in its simplest form; and, thirdly, goodness of fit in most applications. While fitting gravity models of aggregate migration flows started taking backstage to microdata analysis in the 1980s, a recent comeback has resulted from increas-ing applications to international migration and from the emergence of statistical theories appropriate for studying spatial interaction. In this paper we review the status quo and argue for greater integration of internal and international migration modelling. Additionally we revisit the issues of parameter stability and distance deterrence measurement by means of a New Zealand case study. We argue that gravity modelling of migration has a promising future in a multi-regional stochas-tic population projection system —an area in which the model has been to date surprisingly underutilised. We conclude with outlining current challenges and op-portunities in this field. RESUMEN: Durante al menos medio siglo, y bas{\'{a}}ndose en observaciones que hab{\'{i}}an sido hechas en primer lugar un siglo antes, el modelo de gravedad ha sido el paradigma m{\'{a}}s com{\'{u}}nmente utilizado para entender los flujos brutos de mi-graciones entre regiones. El {\'{e}}xito de este modelo se debe, en primer lugar, a su intuitiva consistencia con las teor{\'{i}}as sobre migraciones; en segundo lugar, tambi{\'{e}}n destaca su f{\'{a}}cil estimaci{\'{o}}n en sus modalidades m{\'{a}}s simples; y en tercer lugar, porque se ajusta muy bien a muchas aplicaciones. Aunque en los 80s. los mode-los de gravedad de flujos de migraci{\'{o}}n agregada empezaron tomando como base el an{\'{a}}lisis de microdatos, recientemente han vuelto a estar de actualidad por las crecientes aplicaciones a las migraciones internacionales y por la emergencia de teor{\'{i}}as estad{\'{i}}sticas apropiadas para estudiar la interacci{\'{o}}n espacial. En este trabajo se revisa la situaci{\'{o}}n y se argumenta a favor de una mucho mayor integraci{\'{o}}n de los modelos de migraciones internas e internacionales. Adicionalmente revisamos tambi{\'{e}}n los problemas de medici{\'{o}}n del par{\'{a}}metro de estabilidad y de la disuasi{\'{o}}n derivada de la distancia aplic{\'{a}}ndolo al caso de Nueva Zelanda. Al final sostenemos que los modelos de gravedad de las migraciones tienen un futuro muy prometedor para la proyecci{\'{o}}n de un sistema estoc{\'{a}}stico multi-regional de poblaci{\'{o}}n, un {\'{a}}rea en la que —sorprendentemente— el modelo se ha utilizado muy poco hasta la fecha.

Several residual methods—the vital statistics method and the forward, reverse, and average survival rate methods—are described, compared, and evaluated. On the basis of a symbolic model representing the population in an age group in terms of migration cohorts, it is shown how the various survival rate formulas, unlike the vital statistics method, fail to make an accurate allowance for the net migration of persons who die during the migration period, except under very restricted conditions of migration. The maximum theoretical errors in the use of the various survival rate formulas, resulting from the inability of survival rates to measure deaths occurring in an area exactly, and the theoretical errors under different conditions of timing of migration, are developed, and suggestions are given as to how the problem may be handled.An adaptation of a paper presented at the 1951 annual meeting of the American Statistical Association in Boston on December 28, 1951, before a session sponsored jointly by the Association and the Rural Sociological Society. {\textcopyright} Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {Few parts of the UK remain unaffected by the surge in migration from central and eastern Europe that has been evident since the expansion of the European Union in 2004. However, the statistical instruments available to measure the multi-dimensional impact of international migration remain inadequate. The lack of empirical evidence to support research and analysis of migrant populations is an issue that affects a broad range of organisations at international, national, regional and local level. The problem is particularly acute in a selected set of local areas, where migrant populations have had a significant demographic, economic and social impacts. This chapter reports on work examining the changing profile and dynamics of the UK's ethnic populations. The estimation and projection of ethnic group populations for local areas requires accurate intelligence on the inflow and outflow of international migrants. In the absence of a definitive source of data that can provide these statistics, the New Migrant Databank (NMD) has been developed which combines alternative sources of international migration data into a common statistical framework for presentation and analysis.The alternative sources of international migration data are summarised and a number of analytical examples are provided to illustrate how the NMD can provide a much improved picture of patterns and trends at a local level and the basis for improved intelligence on local estimates of both short-term and long-term migration. A number of developments are suggested, both to focus future research and to extend the content and value of the NMD as a common source of intelligence on UK immigration and emigration.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Emigration first increases and then decreases as a country experiences economic development. This inverted U-shaped, cross-sectional relationship between emigration and development was first hypothesized by Zelinsky's theory of the mobility transition. Although several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the upward segment of the curve (the most common being the existence of financial constraints), they have not been examined in a systematic way. In this paper, we propose two decomposition methods to disentangle the main drivers of the mobility transition curve to OECD destination countries. Our simple decompositions shed light on the role of both microeconomic drivers (i.e., financial incentives and constraints) and macroeconomic drivers, as well as the skill composition of the population. Our double decomposition further distinguishes between migration aspirations and realization rates by education level. Overall, we provide consistent evidence that the role of financial constraints, while relevant for the poorest countries, is limited. Rather, a large fraction of the increasing segment is explained by the skill composition and by macroeconomic drivers (i.e., by factors that do not change in the short-run).},

abstract = {Daily interactions naturally define social circles. Individuals tend to be friends with the people they spend time with and they choose to spend time with their friends, inextricably entangling physical location and social relationships. As a result, it is possible to predict not only someone's location from their friends' locations but also friendship from spatial and temporal co-occurrence. While several models have been developed to separately describe mobility and the evolution of social networks, there is a lack of studies coupling social interactions and mobility. In this work, we introduce a model that bridges this gap by explicitly considering the feedback of mobility on the formation of social ties. Data coming from three online social networks (Twitter, Gowalla and Brightkite) is used for validation. Our model reproduces various topological and physical properties of the networks not captured by models uncoupling mobility and social interactions such as: i) the total size of the connected components, ii) the distance distribution between connected users, iii) the dependence of the reciprocity on the distance, iv) the variation of the social overlap and the clustering with the distance. Besides numerical simulations, a mean-field approach is also used to study analytically the main statistical features of the networks generated by a simplified version of our model. The robustness of the results to changes in the model parameters is explored, finding that a balance between friend visits and long-range random connections is essential to reproduce the geographical features of the empirical networks. {\textcopyright} 2014 Grabowicz et al.},

This article draws on a repository of data established under the IMAGE (Internal Migration Around the GlobE) project to address this deficit by constructing the first comprehensive league table of internal migration intensities for countries around the world. We review previous work, outline the major impediments to making reliable comparisons, and set out a methodology that combines a novel estimation procedure with a flexible spatial aggregation facility. We present the results in the form of league tables of aggregate crude migration intensities that capture all changes of address over one-year or five-year intervals for 96 countries, representing four-fifths of the global population. Explanation for the observed differences has been sought, inter alia, in historical, structural, cultural, and economic forces. We examine the links between development and migration intensity through simple correlations using a range of demographic, economic, and social variables. Results reveal clear associations between internal migration intensities and selected indicators of national development.},

abstract = {Since the release of the digital archives of Defense Meteorological Satellite Program Operational Line Scanner (DMSP/OLS) nighttime light data in 1992, a variety of datasets based on this database have been produced and applied to monitor and analyze human activities and natural phenomena. However, differences among these datasets and how they have been applied may potentially confuse researchers working with these data. In this paper, we review the ways in which data from DMSP/OLS nighttime light images have been applied over the past two decades, focusing on differences in data processing, research trends, and the methods used among the different application areas. Five main datasets extracted from this database have led to many studies in various research areas over the last 20 years, and each dataset has its own strengths and limitations. The number of publications based on this database and the diversity of authors and institutions involved have shown promising growth. In addition, researchers have accumulated vast experience retrieving data on the spatial and temporal dynamics of settlement, demographics, and socioeconomic parameters, which are “hotspot” applications in this field. Researchers continue to develop novel ways to extract more information from the DMSP/OLS database and apply the data to interdisciplinary research topics. We believe that DMSP/OLS nighttime light data will play an important role in monitoring and analyzing human activities and natural phenomena from space in the future, particularly over the long term. A transparent platform that encourages data sharing, communication, and discussion of extraction methods and synthesis activities will benefit researchers as well as public and political stakeholders.},

In an analysis of historic data from 2004 until 2012, we draw on records from the search engine Google and online encyclopedia Wikipedia as well as judgments from the service Amazon Mechanical Turk. We find evidence of links between Internet searches relating to politics or business and subsequent stock market moves. In particular, we find that an increase in search volume for these topics tends to precede stock market falls. We suggest that extensions of these analyses could offer insight into large-scale information flow before a range of real-world events.},

Such forecasts would be an input to the production of probabilistic population projections for all countries, which is currently being considered by the United Nations. To evaluate the method, we conducted an out-of-sample cross-validation experiment, fitting the model to the data from 1950-1995 and using the estimated model to forecast for the subsequent 10 years. The 10-year predictions had a mean absolute error of about 1 year, about 40 {\%} less than the current UN methodology. The probabilistic forecasts were calibrated in the sense that, for example, the 80 {\%} prediction intervals contained the truth about 80 {\%} of the time. We illustrate our method with results from Madagascar (a typical country with steadily improving life expectancy), Latvia (a country that has had a mortality crisis), and Japan (a leading country). We also show aggregated results for South Asia, a region with eight countries. Free, publicly available R software packages called bayesLife and bayesDem are available to implement the method.},

abstract = {International migration will play an increasing role in the demographic future of most nations if fertility continues to decline globally. We developed an algorithm to project future numbers of international migrants from any country or region to any other. The proposed generalized linear model (GLM) used geographic and demographic independent variables only (the population and area of origins and destinations of migrants, the distance between origin and destination, the calendar year, and indicator variables to quantify nonrandom characteristics of individual countries). The dependent variable, yearly numbers of migrants, was quantified by 43653 reports from 11 countries of migration from 228 origins and to 195 destinations during 1960-2004. The final GLM based on all data was selected by the Bayesian information criterion. The number of migrants per year from origin to destination was proportional to (population of origin)(0.86)(area of origin)(-0.21)(population of destination)(0.36)(distance)(-0.97), multiplied by functions of year and country-specific indicator variables. The number of emigrants from an origin depended on both its population and its population density. For a variable initial year and a fixed terminal year 2004, the parameter estimates appeared stable. Multiple R(2), the fraction of variation in log numbers of migrants accounted for by the starting model, improved gradually with recentness of the data: R(2) = 0.57 for data from 1960 to 2004, R(2) = 0.59 for 1985-2004, R(2) = 0.61 for 1995-2004, and R(2) = 0.64 for 2000-2004. The migration estimates generated by the model may be embedded in deterministic or stochastic population projections.},

A pure demographic approach using age and sex-specific parameters of migration intensities cannot fully capture the migration trends over time. One of the approaches that can be used for a better description of past trends and forecasting of future trends is to use additional non-demographic information such as regional economic indicators. In this paper we compare the predictive performance of pure demographic and extended economic-geographical models using data of four European countries at the so-called NUTS 2 level. The models are nested within a GLM specification that allows both demographic and extended models to be written as specific cases of log-linear models. Therefore model fit and performance can be compared directly.},

Such datasets are becoming accessible to an increasingly broad community of researchers and data scientists, with a variety of analytical and policy uses proposed. This paper provides an overview of the state of the art in this area of research, then sets out a new analytical framework for such data sources that focuses on three pressing issues: first, interpretation and disciplinary bias; second, the potential risks to data subjects in low- and middle-income countries and possible ethical responses; and third, the likelihood of ‘function creep' from benign to less benign uses. Using the case study of a data science challenge involving West African mobile phone data, I argue that human mobility is becoming legible in new, more detailed ways, and that this carries with it the dual risk of rendering certain groups invisible and of misinterpreting what is visible. Thus, this emerging ability to track movement in real time offers both the possibility of improved responses to conflict and forced migration, but also unprecedented power to surveil and control unwanted population movement.},

abstract = {One of the perceived strengths of Bayesian modelling is the ability to include prior information. Although objective or noninformative priors might be preferred in some situations, in many other applications the Bayesian framework offers a real opportunity to formally combine data with information available from experts. The question addressed in this paper is how to elicit this information in a form suitable for prior modelling. Particular attention is paid to geographic data for which maps might be used to assist in the elicitation. Two case studies are used to illustrate the methodology: estimation of city house prices and prediction of presence of a rare species.},

abstract = {This article considers the accuracy of the official national population projections made for the UK over the last fifty years The findings take account of the revision to population estimates following the 2001 Census and are largely similar to the findings of a previous review carried out after the 1991 Census. The total population has been projected reasonably accurately but this is largely a chance result of compensating errors in the assumptions of fertility, mortality and net migration. The largest differences between projected and actual populations are for the very young and the very old, while projections of the working age population have been comparatively accurate. Fertility and mortality errors have reduced in more recent projections, while migration errors have grown. However, this may simply reflect the volatility or stability of the respective time-series at the time the projections are made. Changes in estimates of the past and current size of the population (highlighted by the revisions made to population estimates following the 2001 Census) are also shown to play a part in explaining projection error.},

Within one generation, the South Korean economy developed from one of the poorest countries in the world during the 1950s to a developed, high-income country by the end of the 1990s. During the latter part of this period, South Korea (hereafter called Korea) experienced rapid demographic change characterized by a steep decline in fertility levels and abnormally high sex ratios at birth. Unlike other East and South-East Asian countries that underwent similar economic and demographic changes, Korea has witnessed a steady decline in the sex ratios at birth since the end of 1990s through 2000s. In this paper, we visualize the current spatial distribution of population born during the peak years of sex ratios at birth.},

abstract = {Lifetime measures of return and onward migration that use place of birth may be rather arbitrary, as they may not capture the essence of “home” region and therefore may not adequately represent ties to place, including where an indi- vidual grew up or went to school. The recent availability of census data that include information on place of residence five years prior to the census, one year prior, and at the time of the census allow an alternative definition of return and onward migration based upon fixed-interval data. Employing data from the 1996 Canadian census, in this paper I first compare and examine the incidence, composition, and spatial patterns and explanations of return and onward migration through measures of lifetime and fixed-interval data. I then suggest a typology of return migration. Findings indicate that although both measures result in similar patterns and demo- graphic effects, fixed-interval measures provide additional detail into the processes at work. Planned returns among younger and older adults that are most likely asso- ciated with education or employment and represent 24 percent of returns define two types of return migration. A third type is more consistent with the stereotypi- cal image of a “failed” migration.},

We combine information from South African censuses and climatic data to build a panel database covering the waves 1997-2001 and 2007-2011. The database enables the examination of the effect of spatiotemporal variability in temperature and precipitation on inter-district migration flows defined by five-year intervals. We employ a gravity approach where bilateral migration flows are explained by climate variability at the origin, along with a number of geographic, socio-economic and demographic factors traditionally identified as potential drivers of migration. Overall, we find that an increase in positive temperature extremes as well as positive and negative excess rainfall at the origin act as a push effect and enhance out-migration. However, the significance of the effect of climate on migration greatly varies by migrant characteristics. Particularly, flows of black and low-income South African migrants are strongly influenced by climatic variables whereas those of white and high-income migrants exhibit a weak impact. We also argue that agriculture may function as a transmission channel through which adverse climatic conditions affect migration.},

abstract = {While probabilistic projection methods for projecting life expectancy exist, few account for covariates related to life expectancy. Generalized HIV/AIDS epidemics have a large, imme-diate negative impact on the life expectancy in a country, but this impact can be mitigated by widespread use of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Thus projection methods for countries with generalized HIV/AIDS epidemics could be improved by accounting for HIV prevalence, the future course of the epidemic and coverage of ART. We propose a method for making probabilistic projections of life expectancy to 2100 for all countries in the world accounting for HIV prevalence, the future course of the epidemic and its uncertainty, and adult ART coverage. We extend the current Bayesian probabilistic life expectancy projection methods of Raftery et al. (2013) to account for HIV prevalence and adult ART coverage. We evalu-ate our method using out-of-sample validation. We find that the proposed method performs better than the method that does not account for HIV prevalence or ART coverage for pro-jections of life expectancy in countries with a generalized epidemic, while projections for countries without an epidemic remain essentially unchanged.},

However, not all cities are equal and a natural hierarchy at local, regional or global scales spontaneously emerges. In this work, we introduce a method to quantify city influence using geolocated tweets to characterize human mobility. Rome and Paris appear consistently as the cities attracting most diverse visitors. The ratio between locals and non-local visitors turns out to be fundamental for a city to truly be global. Focusing only on urban residents' mobility flows, a city-to-city network can be constructed. This network allows us to analyse centrality measures at different scales. New York and London play a central role on the global scale, while urban rankings suffer substantial changes if the focus is set at a regional level.},

abstract = {The Bayesian approach has a number of attractive properties for forecasting uncertainty which have yet to be fully explored in the study of future population change. In this paper, we apply some simple Bayesian time series models to obtain future population estimates with uncertainty for England and Wales. Uncertainty in model choice is incorporated through Bayesian model averaging techniques. The resulting predictive distributions from Bayesian forecasting models have two main advantages over those obtained using more traditional stochastic models. First, uncertainties in the data, the model parameters and model choice are explicitly represented using probability distributions. As a result, more realistic probabilistic population forecasts are obtained. Second, Bayesian models formally allow the incorporation of expert opinion, including uncertainty, into the forecast. We conclude by discussing our results in relation to classical time series methods and existing cohort component estimates.},

abstract = {Mobile phone data are increasingly being used to quantify the movements of human populations for a wide range of social, scientific and public health research. However, making population-level inferences using these data is complicated by differential ownership of phones among different demographic groups that may exhibit variable mobility. Here, we quantify the effects of ownership bias on mobility estimates by coupling two data sources from the same country during the same time frame. We analyse mobility patterns from one of the largest mobile phone datasets studied, representing the daily movements of nearly 15 million individuals in Kenya over the course of a year. We couple this analysis with the results from a survey of socioeconomic status, mobile phone ownership and usage patterns across the country, providing regional estimates of population distributions of income, reported airtime expenditure and actual airtime expenditure across the country. We match the two data sources and show that mobility estimates are surprisingly robust to the substantial biases in phone ownership across different geographical and socioeconomic groups.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The quantification of parasite movements can provide valuable information for control strategy planning across all transmission intensities. Mobile parasite carrying individuals can instigate transmission in receptive areas, spread drug resistant strains and reduce the effectiveness of control strategies. The identification of mobile demographic groups, their routes of travel and how these movements connect differing transmission zones, potentially enables limited resources for interventions to be efficiently targeted over space, time and populations. METHODS: National population censuses and household surveys provide individual-level migration, travel, and other data relevant for understanding malaria movement patterns. Together with existing spatially referenced malaria data and mathematical models, network analysis techniques were used to quantify the demographics of human and malaria movement patterns in Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. Movement networks were developed based on connectivity and magnitudes of flow within each country and compared to assess relative differences between regions and demographic groups. Additional malaria-relevant characteristics, such as short-term travel and bed net use, were also examined. RESULTS: Patterns of human and malaria movements varied between demographic groups, within country regions and between countries. Migration rates were highest in 20-30 year olds in all three countries, but when accounting for malaria prevalence, movements in the 10-20 year age group became more important. Different age and sex groups also exhibited substantial variations in terms of the most likely sources, sinks and routes of migration and malaria movement, as well as risk factors for infection, such as short-term travel and bed net use. CONCLUSION: Census and survey data, together with spatially referenced malaria data, GIS and network analysis tools, can be valuable for identifying, mapping and quantifying regional connectivities and the mobility of different demographic groups. Demographically-stratified HPM and malaria movement estimates can provide quantitative evidence to inform the design of more efficient intervention and surveillance strategies that are targeted to specific regions and population groups.},

Using a new real wage data base, the results support the pioneering work of Richard Easterlin: rates of natural increase in Europe and income gaps between Europe and overseas were both important, while any additional influence associated with industrialization was modest. The network effects of previous migrants were very strong. The upswing of the emigration cycle was dominated by the earlier stages of the demographic transition and industrialization, reinforced by the rising stock of migrants abroad. On the downswing of the cycle these forces ebbed and were increasingly dominated by the convergence of real wages in the Old World on real wages in the New.},

@article{Pindolia2014,
abstract = {Background: Identifying human and malaria parasite movements is important for control planning across all transmission intensities. Imported infections can reintroduce infections into areas previously free of infection, maintain 'hotspots' of transmission and import drug resistant strains, challenging national control programmes at a variety of temporal and spatial scales. Recent analyses based on mobile phone usage data have provided valuable insights into population and likely parasite movements within countries, but these data are restricted to sub-national analyses, leaving important cross-border movements neglected. Methods. National census data were used to analyse and model cross-border migration and movement, using East Africa as an example. 'Hotspots' of origin-specific immigrants from neighbouring countries were identified for Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda. Populations of origin-specific migrants were compared to distance from origin country borders and population size at destination, and regression models were developed to quantify and compare differences in migration patterns. Migration data were then combined with existing spatially-referenced malaria data to compare the relative propensity for cross-border malaria movement in the region. Results: The spatial patterns and processes for immigration were different between each origin and destination country pair. Hotspots of immigration, for example, were concentrated close to origin country borders for most immigrants to Tanzania, but for Kenya, a similar pattern was only seen for Tanzanian and Ugandan immigrants. Regression model fits also differed between specific migrant groups, with some migration patterns more dependent on population size at destination and distance travelled than others. With these differences between immigration patterns and processes, and heterogeneous transmission risk in East Africa and the surrounding region, propensities to import malaria infections also likely show substantial variations. Conclusion: This was a first attempt to quantify and model cross-border movements relevant to malaria transmission and control. With national census available worldwide, this approach can be translated to construct a cross-border human and malaria movement evidence base for other malaria endemic countries. The outcomes of this study will feed into wider efforts to quantify and model human and malaria movements in endemic regions to facilitate improved intervention planning, resource allocation and collaborative policy decisions. {\textcopyright} 2014 Pindolia et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

@article{chakraborty2013sim,
abstract = {As a result of increased mobility patterns of workers, explaining labor flows and partitioning regions into local labor markets (LLMs) have become important economic issues. For the former, it is useful to understand jointly where individuals live and where they work. For the latter, such markets attempt to delineate regions with a high proportion of workers both living and working. To address these questions, we separate the problem into two stages. First, we introduce a stochastic modeling approach using a hierarchical spatial interaction specification at the individual level, incorporating individual-level covariates, origin (O) and destination (D) covariates, and spatial structure. We fit the model within a Bayesian framework. Such modeling enables posterior inference regarding the importance of these components as well as the O-D matrix of flows. Nested model comparison is available as well. For computational convenience, we start with a minimum market configuration (MMC) upon which our model is overlaid. At the second stage, after model fitting and inference, we turn to LLM creation. We introduce a utility with regard to the performance of an LLM partition and, with posterior samples, we can obtain the posterior distribution of the utility for any given LLM specification which we view as a partition of the MMC. We further provide an explicit algorithm to obtain good partitions according to this utility, employing these posterior distributions. However, the space of potential market partitions is huge and we discuss challenges regarding selection of the number of markets and comparison of partitions using this utility. Our approach is illustrated using a rich dataset for the region of Arag{\'{o}}n in Spain. In particular, we analyze the full dataset and also a sample. Future data collection will arise as samples of the working population so assessing population level inference from the sample is useful. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This chapter outlines a new method for estimating a series of global migration flow tables. This new methodology is shown here to underestimate the total flows for the systems where we have comparable data and as stocks reflect historical flows, there are also problems with over estimation and under estimation between particular country combinations. The first stage of the new estimation process is to calculate bilateral migration rates or probabilities relative to the total stock population. A proportional relationship exists between stocks and flows in the rest of the global system and the relationship can be employed to achieve more accurate estimates of global flows. The method should be viewed more as a step in the right direction for migration flow estimation rather than a definitive solution to the problem of knowing which countries people are likely to be migrating between in any given year.},

abstract = {International migration has reached unprecedented scale, diversity and political, economic, social and demographic significance in Asia over the last decade. Despite this data collection of migrant stocks and flows remains very limited in most Asian countries. Accordingly, policy making on migration in the region lacks an evidence base and is influenced by interest groups, anecdotal evidence and prejudice. This paper argues that the heightened security consciousness since 911 together with the development of efficient computer based collection and analysis of migration data systems has created a propitious environment for bringing about a parametric improvement in data collection on international migration in Asia. A number of suggestions are made in this regard, especially the inclusion of relevant international migration questions in the 2010 round of population censuses. Add cours de la derni{\`{e}}re d{\'{e}}cennie, la migration internationale a atteint en Asie un niveau sans pr{\'{e}}c{\'{e}}dent en ce qui concerne son ampleur et sa diversit{\'{e}}, ainsi que son importance politique, {\'{e}}conomique, sociale et d{\'{e}}mographique.

abstract = {Research endeavours require the collaborative effort of an increasing number of individuals. International scientific collaborations are particularly important for HIV and HPV co-infection studies, since the burden of disease is rising in developing countries, but most experts and research funds are found in developed countries, where the prevalence of HIV is low. The objective of our study was to investigate patterns of international scientific collaboration in HIV and HPV research using social network analysis. Through a systematic review of the literature, we obtained epidemiological data, as well as data on countries and authors involved in co-infection studies. The collaboration network was analysed in respect to the following: centrality, density, modularity, connected components, distance, clustering and spectral clustering. We observed that for many low- and middle-income countries there were no epidemiological estimates of HPV infection of the cervix among HIV-infected individuals. Most studies found only involved researchers from the same country (64{\%}). Studies derived from international collaborations including high-income countries and either low- or middle-income countries had on average three times larger sample sizes than those including only high-income countries or low-income countries. The high global clustering coefficient (0.9) coupled with a short average distance between researchers (4.34) suggests a "small-world phenomenon." Researchers from high-income countries seem to have higher degree centrality and tend to cluster together in densely connected communities. We found a large well-connected community, which encompasses 70{\%} of researchers, and 49 other small isolated communities. Our findings suggest that in the field of HIV and HPV, there seems to be both room and incentives for researchers to engage in collaborations between countries of different income-level. Through international collaboration resources available to researchers in high-income countries can be efficiently used to enroll more participants in low- and middle-income countries.},

abstract = {Recently, the phenomenal advent of photo-sharing services, such as Flickr and Panoramio, have led to volumous community-contributed photos with text tags, timestamps, and geographic references on the Internet. The photos, together with their time- and geo-references, become the digital footprints of photo takers and implicitly document their spatiotemporal movements. This study aims to leverage the wealth of these enriched online photos to analyze people's travel patterns at the local level of a tour destination. Specifically, we focus our analysis on two aspects: (1) tourist movement patterns in relation to the regions of attractions (RoA), and (2) topological characteristics of travel routes by different tourists. To do so, we first build a statistically reliable database of travel paths from a noisy pool of community-contributed geotagged photos on the Internet. We then investigate the tourist traffic flow among different RoAs by exploiting the Markov chain model. Finally, the topological characteristics of travel routes are analyzed by performing a sequence clustering on tour routes. Testings on four major cities demonstrate promising results of the proposed system. {\textcopyright} 2012 ACM 2157-6904/2012/05-ART56 {\$}10.00.},

abstract = {Human movement plays a key role in economies and development, the delivery of services, and the spread of infectious diseases. However, it remains poorly quantified partly because reliable data are often lacking, particularly for low-income countries. The most widely available are migration data from human population censuses, which provide valuable information on relatively long timescale relocations across countries, but do not capture the shorter-scale patterns, trips less than a year, that make up the bulk of human movement. Census-derived migration data may provide valuable proxies for shorter-term movements however, as substantial migration between regions can be indicative of well connected places exhibiting high levels of movement at finer time scales, but this has never been examined in detail. Here, an extensive mobile phone usage data set for Kenya was processed to extract movements between counties in 2009 on weekly, monthly, and annual time scales and compared to data on change in residence from the national census conducted during the same time period. We find that the relative ordering across Kenyan counties for incoming, outgoing and between-county movements shows strong correlations. Moreover, the distributions of trip durations from both sources of data are similar, and a spatial interaction model fit to the data reveals the relationships of different parameters over a range of movement time scales. Significant relationships between census migration data and fine temporal scale movement patterns exist, and results suggest that census data can be used to approximate certain features of movement patterns across multiple temporal scales, extending the utility of census-derived migration data.},

Following the Second World War, the flow of international students undertaking courses at all levels grew rapidly as developing countries sought to educate their populations. By the century{\&}{\#}039;s end, there were an estimated 1.5 million students studying internationally at the HE level. Driving this market expansion was a combination of forces that both pushed the students from their countries of origin and simultaneously pulled them toward certain host nations. By the 1990s, the HE systems of many host nations (e.g. Australia, Canada, the USA, the UK and New Zealand) had become more market focused and institutions were adopting professional marketing strategies to recruit students into fee-paying programs. For many education institutions such fees had become a critical source of financing.

The reach, volume and speed of modern travel are unprecedented, with human mobility increasing in high income countries by over 1000-fold since 1800. This growth is putting people at risk from the emergence of new strains of familiar diseases, and from completely new diseases, while ever more cases of the movement of both disease vectors and the diseases they carry are being seen. Pathogens and their vectors can now move further, faster and in greater numbers than ever before. Equally however, we now have access to the most detailed and comprehensive datasets on human mobility and pathogen distributions ever assembled, in order to combat these threats. This short review paper provides an overview of these datasets, with a particular focus on low income regions, and covers briefly approaches used to combine them to help us understand and control some of the negative effects of population and pathogen movements.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the application of general linear modelling principles to analysing migration flows between areas. Particular attention is paid to specifying the form of the regression and error components, and the nature of departures from Poisson randomness. Extensions to take account of spatial and temporal correlation are discussed as well as constrained estimation. The issue of specification bears on the testing of migration theories, and assessing the role migration plays in job and housing markets: the direction and significance of the effects of economic variates on migration depends on the specification of the statistical model. The application is in the context of migration in London and South East England in the 1970s and 1980s.},

abstract = {Rapid urbanization places increasing stress on already burdened transportation systems, resulting in delays and poor levels of service. Billions of spatiotemporal call detail records (CDRs) collected from mobile devices create new opportunities to quantify and solve these problems. However, there is a need for tools to map new data onto existing transportation infrastructure. In this work, we propose a system that leverages this data to identify patterns in road usage. First, we develop an algorithm to mine billions of calls and learn location transition probabilities of callers. These transition probabilities are then upscaled with demographic data to estimate origin-destination (OD) flows of residents between any two intersections of a city. Next, we implement a distributed incremental traffic assignment algorithm to route these flows on road networks and estimate congestion and level of service for each roadway. From this assignment, we construct a bipartite usage network by connecting census tracts to the roads used by their inhabitants. Comparing the topologies of the physical road network and bipartite usage network allows us to classify each road's role in a city's transportation network and detect causes of local bottlenecks. Finally, we demonstrate an interactive, web-based visualization platform that allows researchers, policymakers, and drivers to explore road congestion and usage in a new dimension. To demonstrate the flexibility of this system, we perform these analyses in multiple cities across the globe with diverse geographical and sociodemographic qualities. This platform provides a foundation to build congestion mitigation solutions and generate new insights into urban mobility.},

abstract = {The pervasive use of new mobile devices has allowed a better characterization in space and time of human concentrations and mobility in general. Besides its theoretical interest, describing mobility is of great importance for a number of practical applications ranging from the forecast of disease spreading to the design of new spaces in urban environments. While classical data sources, such as surveys or census, have a limited level of geographical resolution (e.g., districts, municipalities, counties are typically used) or are restricted to generic workdays or weekends, the data coming from mobile devices can be precisely located both in time and space. Most previous works have used a single data source to study human mobility patterns. Here we perform instead a cross-check analysis by comparing results obtained with data collected from three different sources: Twitter, census, and cell phones. The analysis is focused on the urban areas of Barcelona and Madrid, for which data of the three types is available. We assess the correlation between the datasets on different aspects: the spatial distribution of people concentration, the temporal evolution of people density, and the mobility patterns of individuals. Our results show that the three data sources are providing comparable information. Even though the representativeness of Twitter geolocated data is lower than that of mobile phone and census data, the correlations between the population density profiles and mobility patterns detected by the three datasets are close to one in a grid with cells of 2×2 and 1×1 square kilometers. This level of correlation supports the feasibility of interchanging the three data sources at the spatio-temporal scales considered.},

The author notes that "the parameterized schedules condense the amount of demographic information, expressing it in a language and variables that are more readily understood by the users of the projections. In addition, they permit a concise specification of the expected temporal patterns of variation among these variables, and they allow a disaggregated focus on demographic change that otherwise would not be feasible."},

abstract = {Globalization and the expansion of transport networks has transformed migration into a major policy issue because of its effects on a range of phenomena, including resource flows in economics, urbanization, as well as the epidemiology of infectious diseases. Quantifying and modeling human migration can contribute towards a better understanding of the nature of migration and help develop evidence-based interventions for disease control policy, economic development, and resource allocation. In this study we paired census microdata from 10 countries in sub-Saharan Africa with additional spatial datasets to develop models for the internal migration flows in each country, including key drivers that reflect the changing social, demographic, economic, and environmental landscapes. We assessed how well these gravity-type spatial interaction models can both explain and predict migration. Results show that the models can explain up to 87 percent of internal migration, can predict future within-country migration with correlations of up to 0.91, and can also predict migration in other countries with correlations of up to 0.72. Findings show that such models are useful tools for understanding migration as well as predicting flows in regions where data are sparse, and can contribute towards strategic economic development, planning, and disease control targeting.},

abstract = {Migration has been defined as spatial or geographic mobility involving a change of residence between clearly defined georgraphic and administrative areas. This study of internal migration involves several types of migratory moves: 1) rural to urban migration, 2) rural to rural migration, 3) urban to rural migration, 4) urban to urban migration, and 5) interregional migration. This paper reviews the sources of data on internal migration and discusses the methods which have been developed to measure internal migration in the attempt by social scientists to study the various aspects of the phenomenon. Internal migration information may be obtained through responses to direct migration questions in censuses and surveys or indirectly through the analysis of aspects of population data of component areas in successive censuses. The methods used in measuring internal migration are classified into 2 main types: direct and indirect methods. The direct measures are based on data from the following census topics: 1) places of birth, 2) duration of residence, 3) place of last residence, and 4) place of residence at a fixed prior date. The indirect methods of internal migration estimation are classified into 2 broad types: 1) the National Growth Rate Method, and 2) Residual Method comprising the Vital Statistics method and the Survivial Ratio method. The principle of the indirect method is that population increment between and 2 dates for any geographic area is the result of natural increase and net migration. In general, an internal migration rate is the number of internal migratory events divided by the population exposed to the possibility of internal migration. In practice, the population of a given area is used as the base for the calculation of in, out, and net migration rates for the area.},

Most efforts on studying human mobility have so far used private and low resolution data, such as call data records. Here, we propose Twitter as a proxy for human mobility, as it relies on publicly available data and provides high resolution positioning when users opt to geotag their tweets with their current location. We analyse a Twitter dataset with more than six million geotagged tweets posted in Australia, and we demonstrate that Twitter can be a reliable source for studying human mobility patterns. Our analysis shows that geotagged tweets can capture rich features of human mobility, such as the diversity of movement orbits among individuals and of movements within and between cities. We also find that short- and long-distance movers both spend most of their time in large metropolitan areas, in contrast with intermediate-distance movers' movements, reflecting the impact of different modes of travel. Our study provides solid evidence that Twitter can indeed be a useful proxy for tracking and predicting human movement.},

In addition, female willingness to follow their spouse is more pronounced with respect to the male one, other things being equal.

can be readily incorporated into the model to handle missing data

are formed for the period 1990-1999 based on data from 1959-1989.
These forecasts are compared to the actual observed values. Results
from the forecasts show the Bayesian prediction intervals to be appropriately
wider than those obtained from the Lee-Carter method, correctly incorporating
all known sources of variability. An extension to the model is also
presented and the resulting forecast variability appears better suited

Our results first suggest that bilateral opinions have a statistically robust and relatively large effect on imports, even when standard and new covariates capturing proximity between countries are controlled for. We interpret this effect as reflecting a positive impact of "bilateral affinity" on trade patterns. We also show that it is possible to go some way towards explaining the variance in bilateral opinions among our sample.

abstract = {Bayesian statistics offers an alternative to classical (frequentist) statistics. It is distinguished by its use of probability distributions to describe uncertain quantities, which leads to elegant solutions to many difficult statistical problems. Although Bayesian demography, like Bayesian statistics more generally, is around 250 years old, only recently has it begun to flourish. The aim of this paper is to review the achievements of Bayesian demography, address some misconceptions, and make the case for wider use of Bayesian methods in population studies. We focus on three applications: demographic forecasts, limited data, and highly structured or complex models. The key advantages of Bayesian methods are the ability to integrate information from multiple sources and to describe uncertainty coherently. Bayesian methods also allow for including additional (prior) information next to the data sample. As such, Bayesian approaches are complementary to many traditional methods, which can be productively re-expressed in Bayesian terms.},

abstract = {The Yangtze River Delta Area (YRDA), especially Metropolitan Shanghai, is undoubtedly the leading economic region in China, and it has become one of the most important population convergence areas. It is also widely considered as the sixth largest urban agglomeration in the world. Concluding that migration is the most important aspect of population dynamics in YRDA, the author studies two important forms of internal migration: migration into or out of YRDA, and migration among different cities within YRDA. The paper explores how both forms of migration jointly influence the population distribution among cities and determine the changes of the city-region structure. Furthermore, the paper makes a demographic projection of the future evolution of the area based on estimates of urban-specific fertility, mortality, and net migration. The author suggests that it is necessary to adopt migration-led development strategy and polices in YRDA, in the context of the national population redistribution and achieving a balanced urban-rural development. The author also suggests that it should strike a good balance between migration and regional sustainability. Furthermore, the author suggests that differential development strategies should be advocated for different cities within YRDA, and it is necessary to strengthen regional coordination system for achieving an integrated regional development strategy in the area.},

Drawing on the findings from research studies undertaken in Indonesia, Taiwan, China and India, the paper examines the factors influencing host country selection and additional research that examines the factors influencing choice of final host institution. Based on these findings the paper argues that economic and social forces within the home country serve to "push" students abroad. However, the decision as to which host country they will select is dependent on a variety of "pull" factors. After drawing together the findings, the paper then examines the implications for governments and education institutions seeking to recruit international students.},

@article{Grecequet2017,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 by the authors. The relationship between climate change and human migration is not homogenous and depends critically on the differential vulnerability of population and places. If places and populations are not vulnerable, or susceptible, to climate change, then the climate-migration relationship may not materialize. The key to understanding and, from a policy perspective, planning for whether and how climate change will impact future migration patterns is therefore knowledge of the link between climate vulnerability and migration. However, beyond specific case studies, little is known about this association in global perspective. We therefore provide a descriptive, country-level portrait of this relationship. We show that the negative association between climate vulnerability and international migration holds only for countries least vulnerable to climate change, which suggests the potential for trapped populations in more vulnerable countries. However, when analyzed separately by life supporting sector (food, water, health, ecosystem services, human habitat, and infrastructure) and vulnerability dimension (exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity), we detect evidence of a relationship among more, but not the most, vulnerable countries. The bilateral (i.e., country-to-country) migration show that, on average, people move from countries of higher vulnerability to lower vulnerability, reducing global risk by 15{\%}. This finding is consistent with the idea that migration is a climate adaptation strategy. Still, {\~{}}6{\%} of bilateral migration is maladaptive with respect to climate change, with some movement toward countries with greater climate change vulnerability.},

I discuss the shortcomings of the three dominant twentieth-century population policy rationales: acceptance of replacement-level fertility as a demographic goal; realizing a "demographic dividend" from the changing age structure; and filling the "unmet need" for family planning. I demonstrate that in all three cases the explicit incorporation of education into the model changes the picture and makes female education a key population policy priority. Population policies under this new rationale could be viewed as public human resource management. I argue that 20 years after the Cairo ICPD the international community needs a new rationale for population policies in the context of sustainable development and that a focus on human capital development, in particular education and health, is the most promising approach.},

Among the three EF dimensions, conceptual flexibility was found to have significant contribution in predicting academic achievement. Findings were discussed with reference to the local education context and the methodological issues involved in the present study.

abstract = {Estimates and predictions of people displaced by environmental changes have been highly instrumental in the ever-increasing attention given to environmental migration in the media. Yet no consensual estimate exists, let alone a commonly agreed methodology. As a result, predictions and estimates have become one of the most contentious issues in the debates on environmental migration. This article seeks to review the key estimates and predictions existing in the literature, as well as the methodologies they are built on, and the problems and caveats they are fraught with. The first part reviews the figures related to current estimates of people displaced by environmental changes, while a second part examines the predictions for future displacements. The next section synthesises the key methodological difficulties and a final section suggests some possible avenues for improvement. ?? 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Although evidence is increasing that climate shocks influence human migration, it is unclear exactly when people migrate after a climate shock. A climate shock might be followed by an immediate migration response. Alternatively, migration, as an adaptive strategy of last resort, might be delayed and employed only after available in situ (in-place) adaptive strategies are exhausted. In this paper, we explore the temporally lagged association between a climate shock and future migration. Using multilevel event-history models, we analyze the risk of Mexico-US migration over a seven-year period after a climate shock. Consistent with a delayed response pattern, we find that the risk of migration is low immediately after a climate shock and increases as households pursue and cycle through in situ adaptive strategies available to them. However, about 3 years after the climate shock, the risk of migration decreases, suggesting that households are eventually successful in adapting in situ.},

abstract = {While ethnic segregation plays an important role in determining the development trajectories of many countries, empirical measures of the dynamics of segregation remain rudimentary. In this paper, we develop a new computational framework to model and measure fine-grained patterns of segregation from novel sources of large-scale digital data. This framework improves upon prior work by providing a method for decomposing segregation into two types that previous work has been unable to separate: social segregation, as observed in interactions between people, and spatial segregation, as determined by the co-presence of individuals in physical locations. Our primary contribution is thus to develop a set of computational and quantitative methods that can be used to study segregation using generic spatial network data. A secondary contribution is to discuss in detail the strengths, weaknesses, and implications of this approach for studying segregation in developing countries, where ethnic divisions are common but data on segregation is often plagued by issues of bias and error. Finally, to demonstrate how this framework can be used in practice, and to illustrate the differences between social and spatial segregation, we run a series of diagnostic tests using data from a single city in a large developing country in South Asia. The case study we develop is based on anonymized data from a mobile phone network, but the framework can generalize easily to a broad class of spatial network data from sources such as Twitter, social media, and networked sensors.},

abstract = {Gender is increasingly recognized as fundamental to understanding migration processes, causes and consequences. In South Africa, it is intrinsic to the social transformations fueling high levels of internal migration and complex forms of mobility. While female migration in Africa has often been characterized as less prevalent than male migration, and primarily related to marriage, in South Africa a feminization of internal migration is underway, fueled by women's increasing labor market participation. In this paper, we report sex differences in patterns, trends and determinants of internal migration based on data collected in a demographic surveillance system between 2001 and 2006 in rural KwaZulu-Natal. We show that women were somewhat more likely than men to undertake any migration, but sex differences in migration trends differed by migration flow, with women more likely to migrate into the area than men, and men more likely to out-migrate. Out-migration was suppressed by marriage particularly for women, but most women were not married; both men's and women's out-migrations were undertaken mainly for purposes of employment. Over half of female out-migrations (versus 35{\%} of male out-migrations) were to nearby rural areas. The findings highlight the high mobility of this population and the extent to which gender is intimately related to the processes determining migration. We consider the implications of these findings for the measurement of migration and mobility, in particular for health and social policy and research among highly mobile populations in southern Africa.},

@article{Kniveton2011,
abstract = {Attempts to quantify the numbers of migrants generated by changes in climate have commonly been calculated by projecting physical climate changes on an exposed population. These studies generally make simplistic assumptions about the response of an individual to variations in climate. However, empirical evidence of environmentally induced migration does not support such a structural approach and recognises that migration decisions are usually both multi-causal and shaped through individual agency. As such, agent-based modelling offers a robust method to simulate the autonomous decision making process relating to environmental migration. The Theory of Planned Behaviour provides a basis that can be used to effectively break down the reasoning process relating to the development of a behavioural intention. By developing an agent-based model of environmental migration for Burkina Faso from the basis of a combination of such theoretical developments and data analysis we further investigate the role of the environment in the decision to migrate using scenarios of future demographic, economic, social, political, and climate change in a dryland context. We find that in terms of climate change, it can be seen that that change to a drier environment produces the largest total and international migration fluxes when combined with changes to inclusive and connected social and political governance. While the lowest international migration flows are produced under a wetter climate with exclusive and diverse governance scenarios. In summary this paper illustrates how agent-based models incorporating the Theory of Planned Behaviour can be used to project evidence based future changes in migration in response to future demographic, economic social and climate change. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The basic univariate stochastic volatility model specifies that conditional
volatility follows a log-normal auto-regressive model with innovations
assumed to be independent of the innovations in the conditional mean
equation. Since the introduction of practical methods for inference
in the basic volatility model (J. Business Econom. Statist. 12(4)
371), it has been observed that the basic model is too restrictive
for many financial series. We extend the basic SVOL to allow for
a so-called {\^{a}}€� leverage effect{\^{a}}€� via correlation between the volatility
and mean innovations, and for fat-tails in the mean equation innovation.
A Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm is developed for the
extended volatility model. Thus far, likelihood-based inference for
the correlated SVOL model has not appeared in the literature. We
develop Bayes Factors to assess the importance of the leverage and
fat-tail extensions. Sampling experiments reveal little loss in precision
from adding the model extensions but a large loss from using the
basic model in the presence of mis-specification. There is overwhelming
evidence of a leverage effect for weekly and daily equity indices.
The evidence in favor of fat-tails is very strong for daily exchange
rate and equity indices, but less so for weekly data. We also find
that volatility estimates from the extended model are markedly different
from those produced by the basic SVOL.},

Combining individual-level census data and geographic master files of metropolitan areas with indirect demographic estimation techniques, we cover 377 cities in seven countries. It is found that, in almost one third of cities, population change and replacement has been mainly determined by migration. The international component was larger than the internal one in more than half of cities. Whereas internal migration tends to decrease with rising city size, international movements tend to increase. Positive net international migration substitutes for the net losses from domestic movements in large cities, but complements the gains in intermediate-sized cities.},

abstract = {This paper focuses on a method for indirectly inferring migration
flows in the absence of migration data, using two successive counts
of birthplace-specific population stocks. Such stocks have been used
in the past to infer patterns of mortality and indeed of net migration.
But a workable method for using such population stocks to indirectly
estimate directional migration flows still eludes us. Widely observed
regularities in the age patterns of outmigration indicate that age-specific
propensities of migration are correlated, and this characteristic
suggests an estimation method that directs attention to the age-specific
relative propensities of two or more flows exhibited in the historically
preceding time intervals, and then uses those past measures of relative
propensities to disaggregate residually estimated net migration flows
into the underlying contributions of inmigration and outmigration.
A detailed demonstration of the method, applied to US data, is set
out in this paper.},

The complexity of such problems forces us to focus attention on those limited aspects of uncertainty which are directly relevant to the tasks for which the model will be used. We discuss methods for constructing the relevant partial prior specifications for these uncertainties, based on the prior covariance structure. Our approach combines two sources of prior knowledge. First, we elicit both qualitative and quantitative prior information based on expert prior judgments, using computer-based elicitation tools for organizing the complex collection of assessments in a systematic way. Secondly, we test and refine these judgments using detailed experiments based on versions of the model which are cheaper to evaluate. Although the approach is quite general, we illustrate it in the context of matching hydrocarbon reservoir history.},

To capture volume, internationalisation, and topic focus, our analysis involves a computer-based topic modelling of the landscape of migration studies. Rather than a linear growth path towards an increasingly diversified and fragmented field, as suggested in the literature, this reveals a more complex path of coming of age of migration studies. Although there seems to be even an accelerated growth for migration studies in terms of volume, its internationalisation proceeds only slowly. Furthermore, our analysis shows that rather than a growth of diversification of topics within migration topic, we see a shift between various topics within the field. Finally, our study shows that there is no consistent trend to more fragmentation in the field; in contrast, it reveals a recent recovery of connectedness between the topics in the field, suggesting an institutionalisation or even theoretical and conceptual coming of age of migration studies.},

abstract = {Comparison and comparability lie at the heart of any comparative social science. Still, precise comparison is virtually impossible without using similar methods and similar data. In recent decades, social demographers, historians, and economic historians have compiled and made available a large number of micro-level data sets of historical populations for North America and Europe. Studies using these data have already made important contributions to many academic disciplines. In a similar spirit, we introduce five new micro-level historical panel data sets from East Asia, including the China Multi-Generational Panel Dataset-Liaoning (CMGPD-LN) 1749-1909, the China Multi-Generational Panel Dataset-Shuangcheng (CMGPD-SC) 1866-1913, the Japanese Ninbetsu-Aratame-Cho Population Register Database-Shimomoriya and Niita (NAC-SN) 1716-1870, the Korea Multi-Generational Panel Dataset-Tansung (KMGPD-TS) 1678-1888, and the Colonial Taiwan Household Registration Database (CTHRD) 1906-1945. These data sets in total contain more than 3.7 million linked observations of 610,000 individuals and are the first such Asian data to be made available online or by application. We discuss the key features and historical institutions that originally collected these data; the subsequent processes by which the data were reconstructed into individual-level panels; their particular data limitations and strengths; and their potential for comparative social scientific research.

Apart from delivering the metrics themselves, relaimpo also provides (exploratory) bootstrap confidence intervals. This paper offers a brief tutorial introduction to the package. The methods and relaimpos functionality are illustrated using the data set swiss that is generally available in R.

Drawing from research on community detection methods, we introduce and apply the Information Theoretic Community Detection Algorithm for identifying and studying the geographic boundaries of migration networks. Using a new set of estimates of country-to-country migration flows every 5 years from 1990 to 1995 to 2010–2015, we trace the form and evolution of international migration networks over the past 25 years. Consistent with the concept of dynamic stability, we show that the number, size and internal country compositions of international migration networks have been remarkably stable over time; however, we also document many short-term fluctuations. We conclude by reflecting on the spirit of our work in this paper, which is to promote consensus around tools and best practices for identifying and studying international migration networks.},

For consistency purposes, the Tibet Autonomous Region, Taiwan, and the islands in the South China Sea were excluded. The statistical model and considerations for temporally comparable maps are described, along with the resulting datasets.

abstract = {The pervasiveness of mobile devices, which is increasing daily, is generating a vast amount of geo-located data allowing us to gain further insights into human behaviors. In particular, this new technology enables users to communicate through mobile social media applications, such as Twitter, anytime and anywhere. Thus, geo-located tweets offer the possibility to carry out in-depth studies on human mobility. In this paper, we study the use of Twitter in transportation by identifying tweets posted from roads and rails in Europe between September 2012 and November 2013. We compute the percentage of highway and railway segments covered by tweets in 39 countries. The coverages are very different from country to country and their variability can be partially explained by differences in Twitter penetration rates. Still, some of these differences might be related to cultural factors regarding mobility habits and interacting socially online. Analyzing particular road sectors, our results show a positive correlation between the number of tweets on the road and the Average Annual Daily Traffic on highways in France and in the UK. Transport modality can be studied with these data as well, for which we discover very heterogeneous usage patterns across the continent. {\textcopyright} 2014 Lenormand et al.},

abstract = {A lthough humanitarian crises, such as the ongoing mass exodus from Syria toward Europe, tend to focus global attention on migration, each year millions of people migrate to and from affected countries throughout the world. Progress has been made in un-derstanding drivers of migration, and we have relatively good data on immigrant populations, but we lack information on how many people leave their country each year to settle elsewhere and who these emigrants are. The impact of migration on the individual and on sending and receiving communities and countries is only partly under-stood. Economic effects can be very different from the impacts on society and culture; some gain from migration, whereas others lose. The lack of knowledge creates systemic risks and uncertainties and frustrates pub-lic debate and the formation of effective policies. As high-level leaders convene to discuss such issues at the first United Nations World Humanitarian Summit, we outline priori-ties for migration data collection, research, and training. CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES. Contrary to common beliefs, international migra-tion has been low for decades (1, 2). In 2015, about 3.3{\%} of the world's population, {\~{}}244 million people, lived in a country other than the country of birth (3). This seems surpris-ingly low given levels of inequality among countries and the proportion of people who desire to emigrate. Wide variations exist in the percentage of a population that is for-eign-born. It is {\textless}1{\%} in China and India, 14{\%} in the United States and Western Europe, and more than 50{\%} in some countries of the Middle East and the Caribbean. Large countries have generally smaller shares of foreign-born than small countries. People have different motives for leav-ing their country. Some escape poverty and threats. Others seek access to quality educa-tion; employment; health care; and amen-ities; or to join a partner, form a family, or reunite the family. In countries without adequate social protection schemes, fami-lies often see migration of family members as a means to diversify risk and sources of income. Transnational social networks may provide social protection not available from the public and private sector at home. Violent conflicts, natural disasters, and other life-threatening situations trigger peak levels of migration. The United Na-tions estimates that 60 million people were},

This paper suggests a unified perspective on estimation$\backslash$ntechniques for multidimensional analysis with incomplete data. The$\backslash$nunified approach emphasizes data structures rather than the values$\backslash$nof individual data elements. The data set is viewed as an interdependent,$\backslash$nhierarchical system which permits creation of models that relate$\backslash$nthe values of individual elements to structural characteristics of$\backslash$nthe data system. The value of missing elements is derived from the$\backslash$nstructure of the whole data set. A 5-step procedure within an overall$\backslash$naccounting framework is described, and several potential problems$\backslash$nwith the procedure are discussed. Data requirements are indicated,$\backslash$nand an overview of available types of flow data and sources that$\backslash$nmay yield relevant data for multidimensional analysis is provided.$\backslash$nNext, additive and multiplicative formulations of log-linear models$\backslash$nand information needed to estimate the log-linear model parameters$\backslash$nare discussed. The computation of expected cell counts is considered$\backslash$nassuming availability of varying amounts of data. A multiproportional$\backslash$nadjustment procedure based on the log-linear analysis of the data$\backslash$nsets is described for estimating the missing data elements. The techniques$\backslash$ndescribed in the paper are applied to real data dealing with the$\backslash$nestimation of social mobility tables and of migration tables.},

We define the international migration network (IMN) as the weighted-directed graph where nodes are world countries and links account for the stock of migrants originated in a given country and living in another country at a given point in time. We characterize the binary and weighted architecture of the network and its evolution over time in the period 1960–2000. We find that the IMN is organized around a modular structure with a small-world binary pattern displaying disassortativity and high clustering, with power-law distributed weighted-network statistics. We also show that a parsimonious gravity model of migration can account for most of observed IMN topological structure. Overall, our results suggest that socioeconomic, geographical, and political factors are more important than local-network properties in shaping the structure of the IMN.},

abstract = {Simple spatial interaction models of human mobility based on physical laws have been used extensively in the social, biological, and physical sciences, and in the study of the human dynamics underlying the spread of disease. Recent analyses of commuting patterns and travel behavior in high-income countries have led to the suggestion that these models are highly generalizable, and as a result, gravity and radiation models have become standard tools for describing population mobility dynamics for infectious disease epidemiology. Communities in Sub-Saharan Africa may not conform to these models, however; physical accessibility, availability of transport, and cost of travel between locations may be variable and severely constrained compared to high-income settings, informal labor movements rather than regular commuting patterns are often the norm, and the rise of mega-cities across the continent has important implications for travel between rural and urban areas. Here, we first review how infectious disease frameworks incorporate human mobility on different spatial scales and use anonymous mobile phone data from nearly 15 million individuals to analyze the spatiotemporal dynamics of the Kenyan population. We find that gravity and radiation models fail in systematic ways to capture human mobility measured by mobile phones; both severely overestimate the spatial spread of travel and perform poorly in rural areas, but each exhibits different characteristic patterns of failure with respect to routes and volumes of travel. Thus, infectious disease frameworks that rely on spatial interaction models are likely to misrepresent population dynamics important for the spread of disease in many African populations.},

abstract = {Human mobility is differentiated by time scales. While the mechanism for long time scales has been studied, the underlying mechanism on the daily scale is still unrevealed. Here, we uncover the mechanism responsible for the daily mobility patterns by analysing the temporal and spatial trajectories of thousands of persons as individual networks. Using the concept of motifs from network theory, we find only 17 unique networks are present in daily mobility and they follow simple rules. These networks, called here motifs, are sufficient to capture up to 90 per cent of the population in surveys and mobile phone datasets for different countries. Each individual exhibits a characteristic motif, which seems to be stable over several months. Consequently, daily human mobility can be reproduced by an analytically tractable framework for Markov chains by modelling periods of high-frequency trips followed by periods of lower activity as the key ingredient.},

abstract = {Recent research suggests that climate variability and change significantly affect forced migration, within and across borders. Yet, migration is also informed by a range of non-climatic factors, and current assessments are impeded by a poor understanding of the relative importance of these determinants. Here, we evaluate the eligibility of climatic conditions relative to economic, political, and contextual factors for predicting bilateral asylum migration to the European Union—form of forced migration that has been causally linked to climate variability. Results from a machine-learning prediction framework reveal that drought and temperature anomalies are weak predictors of asylum migration, challenging simplistic notions of climate-driven refugee flows. Instead, core contextual characteristics shape latent migration potential whereas political violence and repression are the most powerful predictors of time-varying migration flows. Future asylum migration flows are likely to respond much more to political changes in vulnerable societies than to climate change.},

Here are presented the circumstances in which microsimulation can be of greater value than the more conventional methods. It is particularly relevant when the results of the process being studied are complex whereas the forces driving it are simple. A particular problem in microsimulation results from the fact that the projections are subject to random variation. Various sources of random variations are examined but the most important is the one we refer to as specification randomness: the more explanatory variables are included in the model, the greater the degree of random variation affecting the output of the model. After a brief survey of the microsimulation models which exist in demography, a number of the essential characteristics of microsimulation are illustrated using the KINSIM model for projecting the future size and structure of kinship networks.},

abstract = {The United Nations (UN) Population Division is considering producing probabilistic projections for the total fertility rate (TFR) using the Bayesian hierarchical model of Alkema et al. (2011), which produces predictive distributions of TFR for individual countries. The UN is interested in publishing probabilistic projections for aggregates of countries, such as regions and trading blocs. This requires joint probabilistic projections of future country-specific TFRs, taking account of the correlations between them. We propose an extension of the Bayesian hierarchical model that allows for probabilistic projection of TFR for any set of countries. We model the correlation between country forecast errors as a linear function of time invariant covariates, namely whether the countries are contiguous, whether they had a common colonizer after 1945, and whether they are in the same UN region. The resulting correlation model is incorporated into the Bayesian hierarchical model's error distribution. We produce predictive distributions of TFR for 1990-2010 for each of the UN's primary regions. We find that the proportions of the observed values that fall within the prediction intervals from our method are closer to their nominal levels than those produced by the current model. Our results suggest that a significant proportion of the correlation between forecast errors for TFR in different countries is due to countries' geographic proximity to one another, and that if this correlation is accounted for, the quality of probabilitistic projections of TFR for regions and other aggregates is improved.},

abstract = {In The Clash of Civilizations, Samuel Huntington argued that the primary axis of global conflict was no longer ideological or economic but cultural and religious, and that this division would characterize the "battle lines of the future." In contrast to the "top down" approach in previous research focused on the relations among nation states, we focused on the flows of interpersonal communication as a bottom-up view of international alignments. To that end, we mapped the locations of the world's countries in global email networks to see if we could detect cultural fault lines. Using IP-geolocation on a worldwide anonymized dataset obtained from a large Internet company, we constructed a global email network. In computing email flows we employ a novel rescaling procedure to account for differences due to uneven adoption of a particular Internet service across the world. Our analysis shows that email flows are consistent with Huntington's thesis. In addition to location in Huntington's "civilizations," our results also attest to the importance of both cultural and economic factors in the patterning of inter-country communication ties.},

abstract = {A criterion is proposed for model selection in the presence of incomplete
data. It's construction is based on the motivations provided for
the KIC criterion that has been recently developed and for the PDIO
criterion. The proposed criterion serves as an asymptotically unbiased
estimator of the complete data Kullback-Leibler symmetric divergence
between a candidate model and the generating model. It is therefore
a natural extension of KIC to settings where the observed data is
incomplete and is equivalent to KIC when there is no missing data.
The proposed criterion differs from PDIO (predictive divergence for
incomplete observation models) in its goodness of fit term and its
complexity term. Unlike AIC, KIC and PDIO this criterion can be evaluated
using only complete data tools, readily available through the EM
and SEM algorithms. The performance of the proposed criterion relative
the ones of PDIO, KIC and AIC are examined in a simulation study.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the conceptual overlaps between transnational return migration and immigration by drawing on a qualitative study of Mainland Chinese return migration from Canada. The paper argues that reframing return migration as a distinct type of immigration draws attention to the citizenship vulnerabilities experienced by "middling" returnees who are not privy to the preferential treatment given to highly skilled returnees. They come to be considered as "foreigners" in their homeland because they have naturalised elsewhere. The paper also explores the double diasporic identifications of Mainland Chinese returnees from Canada; it highlights the tensions and fissures manifested in secondary diasporas, particularly in light of China's growing prominence in international business, foreign diplomacy and cultural exchanges. The paper suggests that social encounters that marginalise such migrants in Canada are reproduced in China. The returnees navigate such encounters by mobilising their transnational affiliations to different national contexts. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

Then, research trends and the evolution for each academic branch are explored. We perform a two-dimensional text mining approach, including bibliometric and network analysis, in order to detect trends of major academic branches. Specifically, the bibliometric characterization aims to assess design research area outputs, while the network analysis intends to reveal research trends in each academic branch of design research and the evolution of core research themes.},

abstract = {This article is concerned with the economic effects of immigration. The emphasis is on Britain, but extensive material is also provided on other countries. Since 1997 a new British immigration policy has displaced previous policy aims, which were focused on minimizing settlement. Large-scale immigration is now seen as essential for Britain's economic well-being, and measures have been introduced to increase inflows. The benefits claimed include fiscal advantages, increased prosperity, a ready supply of labor, and improvements to the age structure. Fears that large-scale immigration might damage the interests of unskilled workers are discounted. This article examines these claims. It concludes that the economic consequences of large-scale immigration are mostly minor, negative, or transient, that the interests of more vulnerable sections of the domestic population may well be damaged, and that any economic benefits are unlikely to bear comparison with immigration's probable substantial and permanent demographic and environmental impact. Our claims are in line with those from other developed countries. CR - Copyright {\&}{\#}169; 2004 Population Council},

Epidemics are strongly seasonal, but the drivers of these fluctuations are poorly understood, which limits the predictability of outbreaks and the dynamic response to immunization. We show that measles seasonality can be explained by spatiotemporal changes in population density, which we measure by quantifying anthropogenic light from satellite imagery. We find that measles transmission and population density are highly correlated for three cities in Niger. With dynamic epidemic models, we demonstrate that measures of population density are essential for predicting epidemic progression at the city level and improving intervention strategies. In addition to epidemiological applications, the ability to measure fine-scale changes in population density has implications for public health, crisis management, and economic development.},

@article{marginson2006dng,
abstract = {Abstract  The paper explores the dynamics of competition
in higher education. National competition and global competition
are distinct, but feed into each other. Higher education produces
'positional goods' (Hirsch 1976) that provide access to social prestige
and income-earning. Research universities aim to maximise their status
as producers of positional goods. This status is a function of student
selectivity plus research performance. At system-level competition
bifurcates between exclusivist elite institutions that produce highly
value positional goods, where demand always exceeds supply and expansion
is constrained to maximise status; and mass institutions (profit
and non-profit) characterised by place-filling and expansion. Intermediate
universities are differentiated between these poles. In global competition,
the networked open information environment has facilitated (1) the
emergence of a world-wide positional market of elite US/UK universities;
and (2) the rapid development of a commercial mass market led by
UK and Australian universities. Global competition is vectored by
research capacity. This is dominated by English language, especially
US universities, contributing to the pattern of asymmetrical resources
and one-way global flows. The paper uses Australia as its example
of system segmentation and global/national interface. It closes by
reflecting on a more balanced global distribution of capacity.},

abstract = {This article proposes a data-driven method to identify parsimony
in the covariance matrix of longitudinal data and to exploit any
such parsimony to produce a statistically efficient estimator of
the covariance matrix. The approach parameterizes the covariance
matrix through the Cholesky decomposition of its inverse. For longitudinal
data, this is a one-step-ahead predictive representation, and the
Cholesky factor is likely to have off diagonal elements that are
zero or close to zero. A hierarchical Bayesian model is used to identify
any such zeros in the Cholesky factor, similar to approaches that
have been successful in Bayesian variable selection. The model is
estimated using a Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling scheme that is
computationally efficient and can be applied to covariance matrices
of high dimension. It is demonstrated through simulations that the
proposed method compares favorably in terms of statistical efficiency
with a highly regarded competing approach. The estimator is applied
to three real examples in which the dimension of the covariance matrix
is large relative to the sample size. The first two examples are
from biometry and electricity demand modeling and are longitudinal.
The third example is from finance and highlights the potential of
our method for estimating cross-sectional covariance matrices.},

@article{Haas2007,
abstract = {ABSTRACT Restrictive immigration policies and the militarization of external border controls by the US and the EU have failed to significantly curb immigra- tion from Latin America and Africa. Rather, they have led to greater reliance on increasingly risky and costly irregular migration and have paradoxically encouraged permanent settlement. A commonly presented ‘smart solution' to curb immigration is to address the perceived root causes of migration through increasing aid or liberalizing trade with origin countries. Recently, policies to stimulate remittances and to promote temporary and circular migration have also been advocated as enhancing home country develop- ment, so that these forms of migration become a medicine against illegal and permanent migration. However, besides the limited scope and credibility of such policies, empirical and theoretical evidence strongly suggests that eco- nomic and humandevelopment increases people's capabilities and aspirations and therefore tends to coincide with an increase rather than a decrease in em- igration, at least in the short tomedium term. Under unfavourable conditions, trade, aid and remittances can be complements to, rather than substitutes for, migration also in the longer term. At the same time, demand for both skilled and unskilled migrant labour is likely to persist. Trade, aid, return migra- tion and remittances are no short-cut ‘solutions' to migration, and sustained immigration therefore seems likely.},

@article{Lutz2019,
abstract = {The relationship between population changes and economic growth has been debated since Malthus. Initially focusing on population growth, the notion of demographic dividend has shifted the attention to changes in age structures with an assumed window of opportunity that opens when falling birth rates lead to a relatively higher proportion of the working-age population. This has become the dominant paradigm in the field of population and development, and an advocacy tool for highlighting the benefits of family planning and fertility decline. While this view acknowledges that the dividend can only be realized if associated with investments in human capital, its causal trigger is still seen in exogenous fertility decline. In contrast, unified growth theory has established human capital as a trigger of both demographic transition and economic growth. We assess the relative importance of changing age structure and increasing human capital for economic growth for a panel of 165 countries during the time period of 1980–2015. The results show a clear dominance of improving education over age structure and give evidence that the demographic dividend is driven by human capital. Declining youth dependency ratios even show negative impacts on income growth when combined with low education. Based on a multidimensional understanding of demography that considers education in addition to age, and with a view to the additional effects of education on health and general resilience, we conclude that the true demographic dividend is a human capital dividend. Global population policies should thus focus on strengthening the human resource base for sustainable development.},

There is an 80{\%} probability that world population, now 7.2 billion people, will increase to between 9.6 billion and 12.3 billion in 2100. This uncertainty is much smaller than the range from the traditional UN high and low variants. Much of the increase is expected to happen in Africa, in part due to higher fertility rates and a recent slowdown in the pace of fertility decline. Also, the ratio of working-age people to older people is likely to decline substantially in all countries, even those that currently have young populations.},

We propose a novel and simple approach, which we call pi-rating, for dynamically rating Association Football teams solely on the basis of the relative discrepancies in scores through relevant match instances. The pi-rating system is applicable to any other sport where the score is considered as a good indicator for prediction purposes, as well as determining the relative performances between adversaries. In an attempt to examine how well the ratings capture a team ' s performance, we have a) assessed them against two recently proposed football ELO rating variants and b) used them as the basis of a football betting strategy against published market odds. The results show that the pi-ratings outperform considerably the widely accepted ELO ratings and, perhaps more importantly, demonstrate profitability over a period of five English Premier League seasons (2007/2008-2011/2012), even allowing for the bookmakers ' built-in profit margin. This is the first academic study to demonstrate profitability against market odds using such a relatively simple technique, and the resulting piratings can be incorporated as parameters into other more sophisticated models in an attempt to further enhance forecasting capability.},

We distinguish between unexpected short-run factors, captured by natural disasters, as well as long-run climate change and climate variability captured by deviations and volatilities of temperatures and rainfall from and around their long-run averages. We start from a simple neo-classical model, which is augmented to include environmental change at origin in the form of amenities. We then test the model us- ing a panel dataset of bilateral migration flows for the period 1960-2000, the time and dyadic dimensions of which additionally allow us to control for numerous time-varying and time invariant factors. Using our primary specification, having accounted for other well documented determinants of migration, we find no direct impact of climatic change on international migration in the medium to long run across our entire sample. These results are robust when further considering migrants returning home. Further condition- ing our regressions upon origin country characteristics, we find evidence that shortfalls in precipitation constraint migration from developing countries which rely more heavily upon agriculture and spur movements from developing countries with fewer groundwa- ter reserves. We further use the rate of urbanization as a proxy for internal migration and find strong evidence that natural disasters beget greater flows of migrants to urban environs.},

Despite the importance of migration as a driver of demographic change, there is limited availability of migration statistics. Generally, researchers rely on census data to indirectly estimate flows. However, little can be inferred for specific years between censuses and for recent trends. The increasing availability of geolocated data from online sources has opened up new opportunities to track recent trends in migration patterns and to improve our understanding of the relationships between internal and international migration. In this paper, we use geolocated data for about 500,000 users of the social network website "Twitter". The data are for users in OECD countries during the period May 2011- April 2013. We evaluated, for the subsample of users who have posted geolocated tweets regularly, the geographic movements within and between countries for independent periods of four months, respectively. Since Twitter users are not representative of the OECD population, we cannot infer migration rates at a single point in time. However, we proposed a difference-indifferences approach to reduce selection bias when we infer trends in out-migration rates for single countries. Our results indicate that our approach is relevant to address two longstanding questions in the migration literature. First, our methods can be used to predict turning points in migration trends, which are particularly relevant for migration forecasting. Second, geolocated Twitter data can substantially improve our understanding of the relationships between internal and international migration. Our analysis relies uniquely on publicly available data that could be potentially available in real time and that could be used to monitor migration trends. The Web Science community is well-positioned to address, in future work, a number of methodological and substantive questions that we discuss in this article. ?Emilio Zagheni worked on this article while he was a visiting researcher at the Wittgenstein Centre (IIASA, VID/{\"{O}}AW, WU), where he received helpful comments on this paper.

abstract = {Oxygenases are promising biocatalysts for performing selective hydroxylations not accessible by chemical methods. Whereas toluene 4-monooxygenase (T4MO) of Pseudomonas mendocina KR1 hydroxylates monosubstituted benzenes at the para position and toluene ortho-monooxygenase (TOM) of Burkholderia cepacia G4 hydroxylates at the ortho position, toluene 3-monooxygenase (T3MO) of Ralstonia pickettii PKO1 was reported previously to hydroxylate toluene at the meta position, producing primarily m-cresol (R. H. Olsen, J. J. Kukor, and B. Kaphammer, J. Bacteriol. 176:3749-3756, 1994). Using gas chromatography, we have discovered that T3MO hydroxylates monosubstituted benzenes predominantly at thepara position. TG1/pBS(Kan)T3MO cells expressing T3MO oxidized toluene at a maximal rate of 11.5 ± 0.33 nmol/min/mg of protein with an apparent Km value of 250 $\mu$M and produced 90{\%} p-cresol and 10{\%} m-cresol. This product mixture was successively transformed to 4-methylcatechol. T4MO, in comparison, produces 97{\%}p-cresol and 3{\%} m-cresol. Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAOI harboring pRO1966 (the original T3MO-bearing plasmid) also exhibited the same product distribution as that of TG1/pBS(Kan)T3MO. TG1/pBS(Kan)T3MO produced 66{\%} p-nitrophenol and 34{\%} m-nitrophenol from nitrobenzene and 100{\%} p-methoxyphenol from methoxybenzene, as well as 62{\%} 1-naphthol and 38{\%} 2-naphthol from naphthalene; similar results were found with TG1/pBS(Kan)T4MO. Sequencing of the tbu locus from pBS(Kan)T3MO and pRO1966 revealed complete identity between the two, thus eliminating any possible cloning errors. 1H nuclear magnetic resonance analysis confirmed the structural identity of p-cresol in samples containing the product of hydroxylation of toluene by pBS(Kan)T3MO.},

abstract = {We show that much of the recent reported decrease in interstate migration is a statistical artifact. Before 2006, the Census Bureau's imputation procedure for dealing with missing data in the Current Population Survey inflated the estimated interstate migration rate. An undocumented change in the procedure corrected the problem starting in 2006, thus reducing the estimated migration rate. The change in imputation procedures explains 90{\%} of the reported decrease in interstate migration between 2005 and 2006, and 42{\%} of the decrease between 2000 (the recent high-water mark) and 2010. After we remove the effect of the change in procedures, we find that the annual interstate migration rate follows a smooth downward trend from 1996 to 2010. Contrary to popular belief, the 2007-2009 recession is not associated with any additional decrease in interstate migration relative to trend. {\textcopyright} 2012 Population Association of America.},

We discuss questions of structure related to the implications for inference on cell counts arising from assumptions about log-linear model forms, and a class of simple and useful prior distributions on the parameters of log-linear models. We then discuss "local move" and "global move" Metropolis-Hastings simulation methods for exploring the posterior distributions for parameters and cell counts, focusing particularly on higher-dimensional problems. As a by-product, we note potential uses of the "global move" approach for inference about numbers of tables consistent with a prescribed subset of marginal counts. Illustration and comparison of MCMC approaches is given, and we conclude with discussion of areas for further developments and current open issues. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The step of identifying to which class of operational situation belongs the current environmental system (ES) situation is a key element to build successful environmental decision support systems (EDSS). This diagnosis phase is especially difficult due to multiple features involved in most environmental systems. It is not an easy task for environmental managers to acquire, to integrate and to understand all the increasing amount of data obtained from an environmental process and to get meaningful knowledge from it. Thus, a deeper classification task in a EDSS needs a full integration of gathered data, including the use of statistics, pattern recognition, clustering techniques, similarity-based reasoning and other advanced information technology techniques. Consequently, it is necessary to use automatic knowledge acquisition and management methods to build consistent and robust decision support systems. Additionally, some environmental problems can only be solved by experts who use their own experience in the resolution of similar situations. This is the reason why many artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have been used in recent past years trying to solve these classification tasks. Integration of AI techniques in EDSS has led to more accurate and reliable EDSS. Case-based reasoning (CBR) is a good technique to solve new problems based on previous experience. Main assumption in CBR relies on the hypothesis that similar problems should have similar solutions. When working with labelled cases, the retrieval step in CBR cycle can be seen as a classification task. The new cases will be labelled (classified) with the label (class) of the most similar case retrieved from the case base. In environmental systems, these classes are operational situations. Thus, similarity measures are key elements in obtaining a reliable classification of new situations. This paper describes a comparative analysis of several commonly used similarity measures, and a study on its performance for classification tasks. In addition, it introduces L ' Eixample distance, a new similarity measure for case retrieval. This measure has been tested with good accuracy results, which improve the performance of the classification task. The testing has been done using two environmental data sets and other data sets from the UCI Machine Learning Database Repository.},

IDPs often urgently require shelter, food, and healthcare, yet prediction of when large fluxes of IDPs will cross into an area remains a major challenge for aid delivery organizations. Accurate forecasting of IDP migration would empower humanitarian aid groups to more effectively allocate resources during conflicts. We show that monthly flow of IDPs from province to province in both Syria and Yemen can be accurately forecasted one month in advance, using publicly available data. We model monthly IDP flow using data on food price, fuel price, wage, geospatial, and news data. We find that machine learning approaches can more accurately forecast migration trends than baseline persistence models. Our findings thus potentially enable proactive aid allocation for IDPs in anticipation of forecasted arrivals.},

We propose a method for coherent forecasting of mortality rates for two or more subpopulations, based on functional principal components models of simple and interpretable functions of rates. The product-ratio functional forecasting method models and forecasts the geometric mean of subpopulation rates and the ratio of subpopulation rates to product rates. Coherence is imposed by constraining the forecast ratio function through stationary time series models. The method is applied to sex-specific data for Sweden and state-specific data for Australia. Based on out-of-sample forecasts, the coherent forecasts are at least as accurate in overall terms as comparable independent forecasts, and forecast accuracy is homogenized across subpopulations.},

abstract = {Human mobility, both short and long term, are important considerations in the study of numerous systems. Economic and technological advances have led to a more interconnected global community, further increasing the need for considerations of human mobility. While data on human mobility are better recorded in many developed countries, availability of such data remains limited in many low- and middle-income countries around the world, particularly at the fine temporal and spatial scales required by many applications. In this study, we used 5-year census-based internal migration microdata for 32 departments in Colombia (i.e., Admin-1 level) to develop a novel spatial interaction modeling approach for estimating migration, at a finer spatial scale, among the 1,122 municipalities in the country (i.e., Admin-2 level). Our modeling approach addresses a significant lack of migration data at administrative unit levels finer than those at which migration data are typically recorded. Due to the widespread availability of census-based migration microdata at the Admin-1 level, our modeling approach opens up for the possibilities of modeling migration patterns at Admin-2 and Admin-3 levels across many other countries where such data are currently lacking.},

abstract = {Much has been written about the 'Death of the West', a demise threatened by the low level of reproduction in Western countries. That fate is contrasted unfavourably with the rapid growth of the populations and economies of less developed countries, and the prospect of the numerical and political marginalization of the formerly dominant developed world. We believe that trends in European fertility have been misunderstood and that, with effort and some pain, their consequences for age structure are manageable. Many European societies also enjoy the advantages of demographic and social maturity, the resilience of established consensual democratic institutions, the rule of law, and civil society. The sizes of China and India raise problems of resource sustainability and vulnerability to climate change. China risks falling into a low-fertility trap, reinforced by urban working conditions unfriendly to family formation. Traditional patriarchal and familist cultures may depress fertility rates to unhelpfully low levels in other less developed countries.},

Apart from the fact that generalized linear models are better suited in dealing with count data, a log-transformation of counts has the additional quandary in how to deal with zero observations. With just one zero observation (if this observation represents a sampling unit), the whole data set needs to be fudged by adding a value (usually 1) before transformation. 3. Simulating data froma negative binomial distribution, we compared the outcomeof fittingmod- els that were transformed in various ways (log, square root) with results from fitting models using quasi-Poisson and negative binomialmodels to untransformed count data. 4. Wefound that the transformations performed poorly, except when the dispersion was small and the mean counts were large. The quasi-Poisson and negative binomial models consistently per- formed well, with little bias. 5. Werecommend that count data should not be analysed by log-transforming it, but insteadmod- els based on Poisson and negative binomial distributions should be used.},

This scale and coverage enable us to develop a globally comprehensive human movement typology.

Fitting statistical models, we validate our data and find that human movement laws apply at 10 times shorter distances and movement declines 40{\%} more rapidly in low-income settings.

composition of immigrants in many Western countries. During the latest
decade, an increasing proportion of the OECD immigrants have been
from poor countries, where the educational level of the population
is low. The migration patterns may be affected by the relatively
generous welfare schemes in most OECD countries, but also network
effects and migration policy changes may be important factors behind
the observed development. This paper presents empirical evidence
on immigration flows into 27 OECD countries during a period of 11
years, 1990-2000. Using a panel data model, we analyze the determinants
of the migration flows. Our results indicate that traditional factors
as cultural and linguistic distance are important. Network effects
are also strong, but vary between source and destination countries.
We do not find clear evidence that selection effects have had a major
influence on the observed migration patterns until now. This may
partly be explained by restrictive migration policies in many OECD
countries which may have dampened the potential selection effects.},

We propose simple estimation of infant migrants, a standard stopping-age in calculating gross measures of migration, and argue for the use of a common population for computing age-standardized measures of migration and a common mortality schedule for computing migration expectancies.

@article{Naaman2011,
abstract = {In the last few years, we are witnessing an emerging class of communication and information platforms some call social awareness streams (SAS) [15]. Available from social media services such as Facebook, Twitter, FourSquare, Flickr, and others, these hugely popular platforms allow participants to post streams of lightweight content items, from short status messages to links, pictures, and videos, in a highly connected social environment. Many of these items are associated with location coordinates in the form of latitude and longitude, or with a business or venue that is in turn associated with a precise location. The number of "geotagged" items is likely to grow with the number of people using geo-enabled devices to access and produce SAS data. The vast amounts of SAS data offer unique opportunities for understanding local communities and people's attitudes, attention, and interest in them. Robust methods for learning from SAS data about geographies and local communities, using methods from Artificial Intelligence, Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing, can greatly improve the state of geographic information retrieval. Such contributions, from better modelling of geographic areas, to improved knowledge about these areas and how they are used by individuals and communities, have begun to surface in the last few years, and are summarized in this article. The structure of this work borrows from Lynch [13], who referred to five elements that make up an individual's perception of city: districts, landmarks, paths, nodes, and edges. This article borrows from Lynch in the context of social media and SAS, proposing the four elements that make up the geographic information that can be derived from social media about a city or area: districts, landmarks, paths, and activities. This article presents a simple model for geographic SAS data, and then considers the four social media elements, or main types of applications of SAS data to geographic information systems. These applications include boundary definition and detection (district); computation of attractions (landmarks); derivation and recommendation of paths; and evaluation of activities, interests and temporal trends.},

abstract = {"This paper analyses migration between the London boroughs using a discrete probability model, but with a correction for excess dispersion to that expected under the Poisson process. Two sources of migration data are used: one-year migration from the 1981 Census; and ten-year migration from the OPCS Longitudinal Study. The evidence from both sets is that both housing and labour market factors are relevant to explaining interborough migration, in addition to the distance and mass terms of the basic gravity model. The labour market effects suggest that migration generally equilibrates differences in excess labour supply between the boroughs, though less strongly in the recession year 1980-81."

abstract = {Global matrices of bilateral migrant stocks spanning 1960-2000 are
presented, disaggregated by gender and based primarily on the foreign-born
definition of migrants. More than one thousand census and population
register records are combined to construct decennial matrices corresponding
to the five census rounds between 1960 and 2000. For the first time,
a comprehensive picture of bilateral global migration over the second
half of the 20th century emerges. The data reveal that the global
migrant stock increased from 92 million in 1960 to 165 million in
2000. Quantitatively, migration between developing countries dominates,
constituting half of all international migration in 2000. When the
partition of India and the dissolution of the Soviet Union are accounted
for, migration between developing countries is remarkably stable
over the period. Migration from developing to developed countries
is the fastest growing component of international migration in both
absolute and relative terms. The United States has remained the most
important migrant destination in the world, home to one fifth of
the world's migrants and the top destination for migrants from some
60 sending countries. Migration to Western Europe has come largely
from elsewhere in Europe. The oil-rich Persian Gulf countries emerge
as important destinations for migrants from the Middle East and North
Africa and South and Southeast Asia. Finally, although the global
migrant stock is predominantly male, the proportion of female migrants
increased noticeably between 1960 and 2000. The number of women rose
in every region except South Asia.},

abstract = {The United Nations released official probabilistic population projections (PPP) for all countries for the first time in July 2014.

Each trajectory was then converted to age-specific mortality and fertility rates, and population was projected using the cohort-component method. This yielded a large set of trajectories of future age- and sex-specific population counts and vital rates for all countries. In this paper we describe the methodology used for deriving the age-specific mortality and fertility rates in the 2014 PPP, we identify limitations of these methods, and we propose several methodological improvements to overcome them.

abstract = {This paper applies the methods of multi-dimensional mathematical demography to project national populations based on alternative assumptions on future, fertility, mortality, migration and educational transitions that correspond to the five shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP) storylines. In doing so it goes a significant step beyond past population scenarios in the IPCC context which considered only total population size. By differentiating the human population not only by age and sex—as is conventionally done in demographic projections—but also by different levels of educational attainment the most fundamental aspects of human development and social change are being explicitly addressed through modeling the changing composition of populations by these three important individual characteristics. The scenarios have been defined in a collaborative effort of the international Integrated Assessment Modeling community with the medium scenario following that of a major new effort by the Wittgenstein Centre for Demography and Global Human Capital (IIASA, OEAW, WU) involving over 550 experts from around the world. As a result, in terms of total world population size the trajectories resulting from the five SSPs stay very close to each other until around 2030 and by the middle of the century already a visible differentiation appears with the range between the highest (SSP3) and the lowest (SSP1) trajectories spanning 1.5 billion. The range opens up much more with the SSP3 reaching 12.6 billion in 2100 and SSP1 falling to 6.9 billion which is lower than today's world population.},

Yet the factors that influence where immigrants choose to settle after arrival remain unclear. We bring evidence to this question by analyzing population-level data for refugees resettled within the United States. Unlike other immigrants, refugees are assigned to initial locations across the country but are free to relocate and select another residence after arrival. Drawing on individual-level administrative data for adult refugees resettled between 2000 and 2014 (N = 447,747), we examine the relative desirability of locations by examining how retention rates and patterns of secondary migration differ across states. We find no discernible evidence that refugees' locational choices are strongly influenced by state partisanship or the generosity of welfare benefits. Instead, we find that refugees prioritize locations with employment opportunities and existing co-national networks.},

abstract = {Traditional space–time paths show the spatiotemporal trajectories of individuals in one to several days. Based on data for such short periods, these space–time paths might not be able to show regular activity patterns, which are pertinent to various types of planning and policy analysis. Travel data gathered for longer periods might capture regular activity patterns, but footprints captured by these data also include irregular activities, introducing noises or uncertainty. Our objective is to determine the representative spatiotemporal trajectories of individuals, accounting for stochastic disturbances and spatiotemporal variability, but using activity data with longer duration. Therefore, we explore using Twitter data, which have relatively low and irregular spatial and temporal resolutions. This article introduces a methodology to construct individual representative space–time paths using various aggregation and spatiotemporal clustering techniques. To depict and visualize spatio-temporal trajectories with uncertain information, we propose space–time cones of variable sizes to reflect the spatial precision of the paths and use colors on the cones to represent the confidence level. To illustrate the proposed methodology, we use the geo-tagged tweets for an extended period. Our analysis indicates that the representative space–time path reasonably describes an individual's regular activity patterns. As visual elements, cones and cone colors effectively show the varying geographical precision along the path and changing certainty levels across different path segments, respectively.},

By measuring the uncertainties of movements using entropy, considering both the frequencies and temporal correlations of individual trajectories, we find that the theoretical maximum predictability is as high as 88{\%}. To verify whether such a theoretical limit can be approached, we implement a series of Markov chain (MC) based models to predict the actual locations visited by each user. Results show that MC models can produce a prediction accuracy of 87{\%} for stationary trajectories and 95{\%} for non-stationary trajectories. Our findings indicate that human mobility is highly dependent on historical behaviors, and that the maximum predictability is not only a fundamental theoretical limit for potential predictive power, but also an approachable target for actual prediction accuracy.},

abstract = {In the aftermath of the March 2011 accident at Japan's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant, the future contribution of nuclear power to the global energy supply has become somewhat uncertain. Because nuclear power is an abundant, low-carbon source of base-load power, on balance it could make a large contribution to mitigation of global climate change and air pollution. Using historical production data, we calculate that global nuclear power has prevented about 1.84 million air pollution-related deaths and 64 gigatonnes (Gt) CO2-equivalent greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that would have resulted from fossil fuel burning. Based on global projection data that take into account the effects of Fukushima, we find that by mid-century, nuclear power could prevent an additional 420,000 to 7.04 million deaths and 80 to 240 GtCO2-eq emissions due to fossil fuels, depending on which fuel it replaces. By contrast, we assess that large-scale expansion of natural gas use would not mitigate the climate problem and would cause far more deaths than expansion of nuclear power.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

We combine recent age- and sex-specific estimates of net rural-urban migration with historical data on rainfall and temperature from the Climate Research Unit (CRU). We also compare standard unweighted estimates of rainfall and temperature to estimates weighted by the proportion of the country's total rural population in the CRU grid. Results show that rural out-migration of young adults is the most sensitive to shifts in weather patterns, with lower rainfall, lower variability in rainfall, and higher temperatures increasing subsequent rural out-migration—though the last of these is not observed in weighted models. The strength of these effects has grown stronger over time for 20–24 year olds, though weaker above age 30. In contrast, increasing temperature variability is associated with a higher rural in-migration of children (0–9) and older adults (55–64). Gender differences in these effects are minimal and concentrated in areas which experienced heavy reductions in rainfall.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Most research on women's labor force return after childbirth concentrates on industrialized countries in the West; the link between economic swings and mothers' work-return behavior is rarely addressed. This study closes these gaps by focusing on South Korea, a developed society in East Asia that has in recent decades witnessed increases in female labor force participation and dramatic economic ups and downs. This is the first relevant study on South Korea. OBJECTIVE This study examines how women's labor force return after childbirth (with and without career interruption) and their career prospects upon work return varied before, during, and after the Asian financial crisis in South Korea. METHODS Logistic and hazard regression models were applied to the Korea Labor and Income Panel Study (KLIPS waves 1-10). RESULTS The study reveals an increase in women's immediate work return after childbirth without career interruption since the 1980s. The Asian financial crisis boosted this immediate return pattern. The implementation of job-protected maternity leave further contributed to this pattern. Women who underwent career interruption at first birth were also more likely to re-enter the labor market during and after the crisis than before. Downward occupational moves were especially common during the period of financial crisis. CONCLUSIONS The results suggest that the Asian financial crisis triggered a noticeable change in women's post-birth work-return behavior. The economic volatility pushed mothers to hold onto their role in the labor force more strongly than before. 1},

The present research examines the impact of uprooting stress on educational Chinese migrants and how students cope with the unanticipated pressure of leaving home. Using a sample of recent first-year students, we employed a longitudinal design that allowed us to examine the interaction effect of coping strategies (primary and secondary coping) and stress at time 1 and their impact on anxiety at time 2. Results indicated primary coping exerted an interaction effect on stress, exacerbating the negative effects and leading to more anxiety at time 2, but secondary coping did not. Females also reported lower stress and anxiety. In conclusion, the impact of uprooting stress and coping on psychological symptoms suggests further research on internal Chinese migration should consider the impact of within-culture variation in Mainland China.},

The starting point is an examination of the dominant perception of ‘migration as a problem'. This is followed by a discussion of some key obstacles to theoretical advancement in migration studies. I argue that a general theory of migration is neither possible nor desirable, but that we can make significant progress by re-embedding migration research in a more general understanding of contemporary society, and linking it to broader theories of social change across a range of social scientific disciplines. A conceptual framework for migration studies should take social transformation as its central category, in order to facilitate understanding of the complexity, interconnectness, variability, contexuality and multi-level mediations of migratory processes in the context of rapid global change. The argument is illustrated through the example of the changing dynamics of labour forces in highly-developed countries. The paper does not put forward a conceptual framework but does suggest some of its possible characteristics.},

Life-log systems, advertisement and smart environments are only some of the applications that can be supported by information regarding user patterns and routine behaviors.

typically select a model from some class of models and then proceed

However, in spite of the ever more collaborative character of scientific research, the issue of gender aspects in research collaborations has been treated in a marginal manner. In this article we apply an innovative bibliometric approach based on the propensity for collaboration by individual academics, which permits measurement of gender differences in the propensity to collaborate by fields, disciplines and forms of collaboration: intramural, extramural domestic and international. The analysis of the scientific production of Italian academics shows that women researchers register a greater capacity to collaborate in all the forms analyzed, with the exception of international collaboration, where there is still a gap in comparison to male colleagues. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Family migration involves different members –spouses, children and parents within a nuclear family as defined by the state. For purposes of immigration, the family generally includes spouses and dependent children usually under the age of 18 years (younger in Germany). At the same time there has been some recognition of new ways of living together and changing gender relations and sexual orientations.2 Yet even in this respect, the progressive openings still require those not complying with traditional family patterns, such as same sex couples, to show that they are akin to the nuclear family (Simmons 2004). Furthermore within the nuclear family, the possibility of bringing in family members is largely restricted to spouses or dependant children and highly dependant parents. Thus the generally limited conceptualisation of the family leaves little consideration for problems generated by caring at a distance (Ackers 1998; Baldassar and Baldock 2000), cultural differences in familial relationships, and the role of grandparents or other collateral relations in providing nurturing and support for different members of the family.

We examine mobility profiles of different nations looking at the characteristics such as mobility rate, radius of gyration, diversity of destinations and a balance of the inflows and outflows. The temporal patterns disclose the universal seasons of increased international mobility and the peculiar national nature of overseen travels. Our analysis of the community structure of the Twitter mobility network, obtained with the iterative network partitioning, reveals spatially cohesive regions that follow the regional division of the world. Finally, we validate our result with the global tourism statistics and mobility models provided by other authors, and argue that Twitter is a viable source to understand and quantify global mobility patterns.},

We seek a method that is consistent with the UN's recently adopted Bayesian method for probabilistic TFR projections for all countries, and works well for all countries. We assess various possible methods using subnational TFR data for 47 countries. We find that the method that performs best in terms of out-of-sample predictive performance and also in terms of reproducing the within-country correlation in TFR is a method that scales the national trajectory by a region-specific scale factor that is allowed to vary slowly over time. This supports the hypothesis of Watkins (1990, 1991) that within-country TFR converges over time in response to country-specific factors, and extends the Watkins hypothesis to the last 50 years and to a much wider range of countries around the world.},

@article{Donato2006,
abstract = {Another special issue on gender? Haven't there been enough of those? When we decided to present the findings of the Social Science Research Council's Working Group on Gender and Migration2 in a special issue, we were certainly familiar with the many special issues and literature reviews focused on women and gender published over the past twenty years. Still we felt that scholarly research on migration and feminist theory had changed so considerably in the past decade that the time was right for again taking stock. Until the mid-1990s, most reviews of scholarly literature focused on single disciplines and on research on women migrants. In the intervening years, in part as a result of the efforts of the Social Science Research Council (SSRC), the study of immigration and migration has become more self-consciously interdisciplinary, and women-centered research has shifted toward, and to some degree has been supplanted by, the analysis of gender. Accordingly, ours is a multidisciplinary review that focuses on gender rather than on women, distinguishing it from its pioneering antecedent, the 1984 IMR special issue, “Women in Migration” (Morokvasic, 1984). We include here surveys of anthropology, geography, history, law and society, political science, psychology, sociology, and sexuality studies, undertaken by scholars whose geographical specialties reach beyond the United States to Asia, Latin America, Africa, and Europe. Our change in perspective reflects two important developments. First, scholars (including those in the 1984 special issue) have succeeded in bringing female migration out of the shadows in many disciplines. Indeed, with demographers claiming that, globally, female migration is now virtually equal to that of males, the phrase “the feminization of migration” is gaining currency. Second, and perhaps more important, many migration scholars now insist that migration itself is a gendered phenomenon that requires more sophisticated theoretical and analytical tools than studies of sex roles and of sex as a dichotomous variable allowed in the past. In this introduction, we point toward some of the largest challenges and greatest rewards of gender analysis. We survey the development of gender analysis historically and across some important disciplines in migration studies. In doing so, we seek to explain why some disciplines – notably anthropology – have generated theory that has influenced neighboring disciplines, creating firm grounds for interdisciplinary discussion. We conclude by looking to the future and pointing to how research design and mixed methodologies might more truly foster interdisciplinary gender analysis of a wide variety of topics of theoretical interest to migration scholars.},

abstract = {Internal migration, the movement of people between localities and regions within a country, has resulted in a significant redistribution of national populations. Past cross-national studies have been impeded by a lack of data and comparable metrics upon which to base comparisons. This paper examines internal migration in 30 Asian countries utilising a global dataset and a novel suite of measures devised in the IMAGE project. Three aspects of internal migration are explored: overall intensity, age patterns, and spatial impacts. Comparisons reveal that internal migration intensities, while on average lower than in other regions, are highly variable across countries. Migration peaks at earlier ages and is concentrated into a narrower age band than in other parts of the world. Analysis of spatial impacts highlights the contribution of migration to urbanisation, but a comparison of current trends against lifetime migration data also reveals the impact of historical events and government policies on national migration systems. Wide variation in key dimensions of migration among Asian countries reflects a diversity in national circumstances. The way forward lies in further in-depth country studies building on the common analytic framework articulated in this study.},

abstract = {It is argued that P-values and the tests based upon them give unsatisfactory results, especially in large samples. It is shown that, in regression, when there are many candidate independent variables, standard variable selection procedures can give very misleading results. Also, by selecting a single model, they ignore model uncertainty and so underestimate the uncertainty about quantities of interest. The Bayesian approach to hypothesis testing, model selection, and accounting for model uncertainty is presented. Implementing this is straightforward through the use of the simple and accurate BIC approximation, and it can be done using the output from standard software. Specific results are presented for most of the types of model commonly used in sociology. It is shown that this approach overcomes the difficulties with P-values and standard model selection procedures based on them. It also allows easy comparison of nonnested models, and permits the quantification of the evidence for a null hypothesis of interest, such as a convergence theory or a hypothesis about societal norms.},

concept in demography and is generally depicted in the form of an
age pyramid. The spatial structure of an interregional system of
origin-destination-specific migration streams is, however, a notion
lacking a widely accepted definition. We offer a definition in this
article, one that draws on the log-linear specification of the geographer's
spatial interaction model. We illustrate our definition with observed
migration data, we discuss extensions and special cases, and proceed
to contrast our definition and associated empirical findings against
another measure having an alternative definition.},

abstract = {Before the Syrian uprising that began in 2011, the greater Fertile Crescent experienced the most severe drought in the instrumental record. For Syria, a country marked by poor governance and unsustainable agricultural and environmental policies, the drought had a catalytic effect, contributing to political unrest. We show that the recent decrease in Syrian precipitation is a combination of natural variability and a long-term drying trend, and the unusual severity of the observed drought is here shown to be highly unlikely without this trend. Precipitation changes in Syria are linked to rising mean sea-level pressure in the Eastern Mediterranean, which also shows a long-term trend. There has been also a long-term warming trend in the Eastern Mediterranean, adding to the drawdown of soil moisture. No natural cause is apparent for these trends, whereas the observed drying and warming are consistent with model studies of the response to increases in greenhouse gases. Furthermore, model studies show an increasingly drier and hotter future mean climate for the Eastern Mediterranean. Analyses of observations and model simulations indicate that a drought of the severity and duration of the recent Syrian drought, which is implicated in the current conflict, has become more than twice as likely as a consequence of human interference in the climate system.},

abstract = {This report, which focuses on three regions—Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and Latin America that together represent 55 percent of the developing world's population—finds that climate change will push tens of millions of people to migrate within their countries by 2050. It projects that without concrete climate and development action, just over 143 million people—or around 2.8 percent of the population of these three regions—could be forced to move within their own countries to escape the slow-onset impacts of climate change. They will migrate from less viable areas with lower water availability and crop productivity and from areas affected by rising sea level and storm surges. The poorest and most climate vulnerable areas will be hardest hit. These trends, alongside the emergence of “hotspots” of climate in- and out-migration, will have major implications for climate-sensitive sectors and for the adequacy of infrastructure and social support systems. The report finds that internal climate migration will likely rise through 2050 and then accelerate unless there are significant cuts in greenhouse gas emissions and robust development action.},

to urban industrial societies from underdeveloped rual areas. It
argues that such migrations are a continuing feature of industrial
societies and that they are generated by forces inherent in the nature

finds such migrations so difficult to comprehend, and challenges
a set of older assumptions that supported the view that these migrations
were beneficial to both sending and receiving societies. Professor
Piore seriously questions whether migration actually relieves population
pressure and rural unemployment, and whether it develops skills necessary
for the emergence of an industrial labour force in the home country.
Furthermore, he criticizes the notion that in the long run migrant
labour complements native labour. On the basis of this critique,
he develops an alternative theory of the nature of the migration

abstract = {This paper first draws attention to the scant literature in population geography on international student migration, or ISM. Yet students comprise an important element in global and European population mobility, especially of highly skilled movements. This study is set within the context of intra-European ISM and looks specifically at the lsquoYear Abroad experiencersquo which has been subsidised over the past 15 years by the Erasmus and Socrates programmes. Empirical data come from questionnaire surveys to three groups of University of Sussex students, surveyed during 2000-01. The main survey was a large postal survey to graduates who had spent a year abroad (YA) in another European country as part of their Sussex degree. This questionnaire was designed to test two sets of hypotheses: firstly that the YA had given students/graduates a more lsquoEuropeanrsquo identity or consciousness, and a greater insight into European issues; and secondly that YA graduates would be more likely to pursue their subsequent career/migration paths in continental Europe. These hypotheses were tested against a control sample of Sussex graduates who had not been on a YA, matched by degree type and time of graduation. A third sample was undertaken with second-year undergraduate students about to embark on their YA, in order to test pre- and post-YA perspectives. The results broadly confirm the research hypotheses, although with a variety of nuances and outcomes. Copyright {\{}$\backslash$copyright{\}} 2003 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

@article{breiman2001,
abstract = {Recent work has shown that combining multiple versions of unstable classifiers such as trees or neural nets results in reduced test set error. One of the more effective is bagging. Here, modified training sets are formed by resampling from the original training set, classifiers constructed using these training sets and then combined by voting. Freund and Schapire propose an algorithm the basis of which is to adaptively resample and combine (hence the acronym “arcing”) so that the weights in the resampling are increased for those cases most often misclassified and the combining is done by weighted voting. Arcing is more successful than bagging in test set error reduction. We explore two arcing algorithms, compare them to each other and to bagging, and try to understand how arcing works. We introduce the definitions of bias and variance for a classifier as components of the test set error. Unstable classifiers can have low bias on a large range of data sets. Their problem is high variance. Combining multiple versions either through bagging or arcing reduces variance significantly.},

abstract = {Approaches and developments in demographic and population forecasting since 1980 are reviewed. Three approaches to forecasting demographic processes are extrapolation, expectation (individual-level birth expectations or population-level opinions of experts), and theory-based structural modelling involving exogenous variables. Models include 0-3 factors (age, period and cohort). Decomposition and disaggregation are also used in multistate models, including macrosimulation and microsimulation. Forecasting demographic change is difficult; accuracy depends on the particular situation or trends, but it is not clear when a method will perform best. Estimates of uncertainty (model-based ex ante error, expert-opinion-based ex ante error, and ex post error) differ; uncertainty estimation is highly uncertain. Probabilistic population forecasts are based on stochastic population renewal or random scenarios. The approaches to population forecasting, demographic process forecasting and error estimation are closely linked. Complementary methods that combine approaches are increasingly employed. The paper summarises developments, assesses progress and considers the future. {\textcopyright} 2006 International Institute of Forecasters.},

abstract = {Projections of the ethnic composition of the UK population presage radical change in the future at both national and local levels. The first question that users of such population projections ask is 'what is driving the results?' The answer can be found in the assumptions made for future mortality rates, future fertility rates, future migration rates and flows, and the age-sex structure of the starting populations. But it is difficult to disentangle the component effects and demographic momentum. We adapt a methodology proposed and used by Bongaarts and Bulatao in 1999 (Population and Development Review 25 515-29) by extending to national, subnational and ethnic group projections, applying it to projections of the ethnic group populations in English local authorities. We assess the roles played by immigration assumptions (the subject of continuous public debate), fertility assumptions, mortality assumptions and internal migration assumptions together with the role of the existing population age structure of each group in each area. Our findings are that positive immigration assumptions contribute to population growth in all local authorities, below replacement fertility lowers the population everywhere, declining mortality compensates for missing babies but substitutes elders and internal migration has very different effects depending on the local authority. Ethnic groups vary enormously in terms of the contribution of the current age structure. The demographic momentum of the White groups produces population declines while it is the most important demographic driver for some but not all of minority ethnic groups. The paper reports on the methods, assumptions and results associated with a systematic set of 'what if' projections. These enable us to determine the demographic drivers of future ethnic population change for England's local areas over the time horizon 2001-2051. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors.

We discuss the benefits and challenges of using digital trace data for social and demographic research, and review examples of current demographic literature that creatively utilizes digital trace data to study processes related to fertility, mortality and migration. Focusing on Facebook data for advertisers –a novel, ‘digital census' that has largely been untapped by demographers – we provide illustrative and empirical examples of how demographic researchers can manage issues such as bias and representation when using digital trace data. We conclude by offering our perspective on the road ahead regarding demography and its role in the ‘data revolution.'},

One estimator may be preferred for certain types of data or research questions but more often the methods should be used in concert to establish robustness. In recent years, estimation has become just a first step before a deeper analysis of the implications of the results, notably in terms of welfare. We try to facilitate diffusion of best-practice methods by illustrating their application in a step-by-step cookbook mode of exposition.},

abstract = {This article reviews Alan Wilson's research on population and migration in the 1970s and the 2010s, which supplements his principal contribution - mathematical modelling of urban and regional systems. In the 1970s, drawing on input-output models of economies and working with Philip Rees, Wilson established the accounting basis for Andrei Rogers' multi-regional projection model, adding international migration. Innovative methods were developed to complete demographic accounts, where there were data gaps. In the 2010s, working with Adam Dennett, Wilson systematized methods for estimating migration flows between regions in Europe, employing his family of spatial interaction models. The key aim of both research strands was to ensure that no information was ignored to ensure consistency in population and migration models. The influence of Wilson's contributions to research on population and migration is traced through a survey of subsequent research.},

The particular appeal of Courgeau's ‘k' statistic is that it purports to provide a single summary index of migration intensity which transcends the differences in zonal systems that commonly confound cross-national comparisons. Courgeau's k is applied to examine differences in mobility between 27 countries, using census data drawn primarily from the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) database maintained by the University of Minnesota. Our goals of the chapter are threefold: first, to establish the strengths and limitations of Courgeau's k as a summary measure of internal migration; second, to identify the extent of international differences in mobility; and third, to determine the general trajectory of internal migration over time.},

We begin with Lee's ARMA model which leads to prediction intervals that are more realistic and informative than point-wise forecasts or traditional scenario methods. The roles of historical information and expert judgment are analyzed in terms of their effects upon prediction uncertainty. Validation experiments suggest that the model performs well in characterizing the uncertainty of the US fertility experience. We argue that the long-run average of fertility, a key assumption of the model, operates on a time scale not probed by time-series methods and we use Bayesian priors to quantify the additional prediction uncertainty that comes from making the long-run fertility assumption.},

Here, we review research at the intersection of evolutionary biology, human geography and epidemiology that is working towards an integrated view of spatial incidence, host mobility and viral genetic diversity. We first discuss how empirical studies have combined viral spatial and genetic data, focusing particularly on the contribution of evolutionary analyses to epidemiology and disease control. Second, we explore the interplay between virus evolution and global dispersal in more depth for two pathogens: human influenza A virus and chikungunya virus. We discuss the opportunities for future research arising from new analyses of human transportation and trade networks, as well as the associated challenges in accessing and sharing relevant spatial and genetic data.},

@article{Walters2000,
abstract = {This paper refines previous typologies of later-life mobility by explicitly evaluating the spatial migration patterns and household characteristics of retired American migrants. Migrants' lifecourse attributes (economic status, disability, presence of spouse), large-scale migration patterns (internal migration) and household characteristics (living arrangements, economic independence, residential independence) are used to identify three types of post-retirement mobility. The first type, amenity migration, has a distinctive spatial pattern that suggests a search for attractive climate and leisure amenities. The second type of mobility, assistance migration, can be traced to low income and the absence of a spouse in the household. It often results in residential and economic dependence - specifically, in co-residence with adult children or other labor force members. The third type of mobility, migration in response to severe disability and spouse absence, tends to result in nursing home residence. While amenity migration has long been associated with good health and favorable economic status, this analysis reveals that many disabled and lower-income retirees share the inmigration pattern typical of amenity migrants. In fact, amenity migration is the predominant type of mobility among those migrants with fewer than two unfavorable lifecourse attributes (low income, severe disability and spouse absence). Unlike previous lifecourse typologies, this study shows no clear relationship between moderate disability and co-residence with adult children. The results suggest that co-residence is primarily a strategy for reducing living costs rather than a means of coping with moderate disability.

abstract = {The total size of the world population is likely to increase from its current 7 billion to 8-10 billion by 2050. This uncertainty is because of unknown future fertility and mortality trends in different parts of the world. But the young age structure of the population and the fact that in much of Africa and Western Asia, fertility is still very high makes an increase by at least one more billion almost certain. Virtually, all the increase will happen in the developing world. For the second half of the century, population stabilization and the onset of a decline are likely. In addition to the future size of the population, its distribution by age, sex, level of educational attainment and place of residence are of specific importance for studying future food security. The paper provides a detailed discussion of different relevant dimensions in population projections and an evaluation of the methods and assumptions used in current global population projections and in particular those produced by the United Nations and by IIASA.},

abstract = {The Yangtze River Delta Area (YRDA), especially Metropolitan Shanghai, is undoubtedly the leading economic region in China, and it has become one of the most important population convergence areas. It is also widely considered as the sixth largest urban agglomeration in the world. Concluding that migration is the most important aspect of population dynamics in YRDA, the author studies two important forms of internal migration: migration into or out of YRDA, and migration among different cities within YRDA. The paper explores how both forms of migration jointly influence the population distribution among cities and determine the changes of the city-region structure. Furthermore, the paper makes a demographic projection of the future evolution of the area based on estimates of urban-specific fertility, mortality, and net migration. The author suggests that it is necessary to adopt migration-led development strategy and polices in YRDA, in the context of the national population redistribution and achieving a balanced urban-rural development. The author also suggests that it should strike a good balance between migration and regional sustainability. Furthermore, the author suggests that differential development strategies should be advocated for different cities within YRDA, and it is necessary to strengthen regional coordination system for achieving an integrated regional development strategy in the area.

abstract = {Migration is one of the most unpredictable demographic processes. The aim of this article is to provide a blueprint for assessing various possible forecasting approaches in order to help safeguard producers and users of official migration statistics against misguided forecasts. To achieve that, we first evaluate the various existing approaches to modelling and forecasting of international migration flows. Subsequently, we present an empirical comparison of ex post performance of various forecasting methods, applied to international migration to and from the United Kingdom. The overarching goal is to assess the uncertainty of forecasts produced by using different forecasting methods, both in terms of their errors (biases) and calibration of uncertainty. The empirical assessment, comparing the results of various forecasting models against past migration estimates, confirms the intuition about weak predictability of migration, but also highlights varying levels of forecast errors for different migration streams. There is no single forecasting approach that would be well suited for different flows. We therefore recommend adopting a tailored approach to forecasts, and applying a risk management framework to their results, taking into account the levels of uncertainty of the individual flows, as well as the differences in their potential societal impact.},

As a means of validating this premise, this study analyzes one component of academic interaction - international study at the level of higher education. This article outlines changes in international study patterns in the decades following World War n and explores how the postwar context affected international exchange relationships. International exchange during the 1960s and 1970s indicated strong participation by students from Third World nations and the popularity of five industrialized host nations. These relationships are explored through a statistical study of the flow of students from 18 developing nations out to the world and to the United States in particular. The findings assess the importance of key economic factors (such as involvement in global trade and concentration of trade), educational variables (including national emphasis on education and the availability of domestic opportunities) and political arenas (such as international assistance and scholarship dependency) in determining international study patterns. As current shifts in our postwar world order unfold before us, better understanding of historical factors underlying international exchange may be instrumental as we anticipate its future within the context of new geopolitical alliances.},

abstract = {Many researchers have used time series models to construct population forecasts and prediction intervals at the national level, but few have evaluated the accuracy of their forecasts or the out-of-sample validity of their prediction intervals. Fewer still have developed models for subnational areas. In this study, we develop and evaluate six ARIMA time series models for states in the United States. Using annual population estimates from 1900 to 2000 and a variety of launch years, base periods, and forecast horizons, we construct population forecasts for four states chosen to reflect a range of population size and growth rate characteristics. We compare these forecasts with population counts for the corresponding years and find precision, bias, and the width of prediction intervals to vary by state, launch year, model specification, base period, and forecast horizon. Furthermore, we find that prediction intervals based on some ARIMA models provide relatively accurate forecasts of the distribution of future population counts but prediction intervals based on other models do not. We conclude that there is some basis for optimism regarding the possibility that ARIMA models might be able to produce realistic prediction intervals to accompany population forecasts, but a great deal of work remains to be done before we can draw any firm conclusions.},

@article{Lutz2017,
abstract = {Martin Luther succinctly summarized his theology in sola statements, such as sola scriptura, viewing the Bible (scriptura) as the only valid source of information about God rather than what he viewed as the extraneous, corrupting church doctrine of the time. As a secular side effect of this focus on individual reading skills, the Protestant terri-tories were the first to acquire high literacy rates, which subse-quently fostered health, economic growth, and good governance. Here I argue that a similar priority focus on empowerment of all segments of all populations through education and health (sola schola et sanitate) is needed today for sustainable development. According to decades of research, education and health are essential prerequisites for ending poverty and hunger, for improving institu-tions and participation in society, for voluntary fertility declines and ending world population growth, for changing behavior and adop-tion of new and clean technologies, and for enhancing adaptive capacity to already unavoidable climate change. This approach avoids paternalistic imposition of development policies by focusing external aid on enabling people to help themselves, their families, and communities. Prioritizing education and health also helps move more industrialized, aging societies from a focus on material con-sumption to one on quality of life. Sola schola et sanitate suggests that well-being will increasingly be based on health, continued men-tal stimulation, and consumption of cultural products, rather than fossil fuels and materials. Thus, cognition—or brain power—can be viewed as the zero-emissions energy for sustainable development. Sustainable Development Goals | reformation | education | health | world population O n October 31, 1517, Martin Luther released his famous 95 Theses, which openly challenged church authorities on the practice of selling indulgences. This happened in a period of tran-sition in Europe with Humanism and Renaissance culture spread-ing, new discoveries being made in geography and science, and the printing machine revolutionizing communication. But this specific date is widely considered as the start of the Protestant Reformation, which triggered a series of highly consequential religious, political, and socioeconomic developments, not only for Germany but also for the world. In particular, the Reformatory emphasis on universal literacy, allowing all women and men alike to read the Bible themselves, led to far-reaching changes. As I will discuss below, this spread of education has ever since been a key factor in the advance of health and technology, subsequent economic growth, and lasting improvements in human living conditions. On September 25, 2015, the political leaders of the world as-sembled at the United Nations in New York and defined a set of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including 169 specific targets that were approved by 193 countries. This followed an ex-tensive international consultation process, with hundreds of dis-cussion fora around the world, including governments and civil society. The resulting set of goals updated the earlier eight Mil-lennium Development Goals (MDGs) and significantly expanded their scope. Importantly, the SDGs do not only apply to developing countries but are formulated as (nonbinding) commitments for all 193 countries. Will these global goals that have been endorsed by the broadest possible coalition of governments and civil society around the world trigger a globally transformative power compa-rable to the teachings of a single monk 500 y ago? Although the answer to this question will only be known in retrospect, it is possible to make some informed observations about the preconditions for success. Here I will propose and discuss the thesis that a successful global transition to sustainability will re-quire as a necessary prerequisite the emphasis on core priorities, similar to Luther's famous sola principles, rather than the tech-nocratic implementation of 169 diverse targets. In Medieval Latin, sola fide emphasized that salvation can only come through direct faith in God, without the mediation of saints or having to worry about the countless behavioral norms defined by the church. It has been called the all-decisive core of the Reformation (1), with ev-erything else—including moral behavior and the organization of many aspects of life—following from this first principle. Such a focus on decisive first principles from which everything else follows was key to the transformative power of the Reformation and, I would argue, could again be the key today for the transition nec-essary for securing sustainable well-being. Education and health for all—sola schola et sanitate—can be viewed as such first principles, which present ends in themselves (i.e., they have intrinsic value) and are essential means and key catalysts for pursuing the rest of the sustainable development agenda (i.e., they have instrumental value). They are essential prerequisites for enabling people to eradicate poverty, to organize their societies in equitable ways, to control those in power, and to manage the planet in a way that allows all humans to prosper for many generations to come.},

The aim of this article is to compare the utility of three models for smoothing and/or graduating these distributions. The three models examined are 1) the Gamma distribution, 2) the Hadwiger function, and 3) the Brass polynomial. Test data sets consist of four types of primates (including humans), Asian elephants, and Przewalski's horse (an extinct species). The results indicate that all three models work well with a variety of mammalian data. The simplest of these models, the Brass polynomial, cannot be rejected based on available data and appears to be the optimum choice. (C) 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

abstract = {As world populations age, the analysis of demographic mortality data and demographic predictions of future mortality have met with increasing interest. The study of mortality patterns and the forecasting of future mortality with its associated impacts on social welfare, health care, and societal planning has become a more pressing issue. An ideal set of data to study patterns of change in long-term mortality is the well-known historical Swedish cohort mortality data, because of its high quality and long span of more than two centuries. We explore the use of functional data analysis to model these data and to derive mortality forecasts. Specifically, we address the challenge of flexibly modeling these data while including the effect of the birth year by regarding log-hazard functions, derived from observed cohort lifetables, as random functions. A functional model for the analysis of these cohort log-hazard functions, extending functional principal component approaches by introducing time-varying eigenfunctions, is found to adequately address these challenges. The associated analysis of the dependency structure of the cohort log-hazard functions leads to the concept of time-varying principal components of mortality. We then extend this analysis to mortality forecasting, by combining prediction of incompletely observed log-hazard functions with functional local extrapolation, and demonstrate these functional approaches for the Swedish cohort mortality data.},

abstract = {Probabilistic forecasts are becoming more and more available. How should they be used and communicated? What are the obstacles to their use in practice? I review experience with five problems where probabilistic forecasting played an important role. This leads me to identify five types of potential users: Low Stakes Users, who don't need probabilistic forecasts; General Assessors, who need an overall idea of the uncertainty in the forecast; Change Assessors, who need to know if a change is out of line with expectatations; Risk Avoiders, who wish to limit the risk of an adverse outcome; and Decision Theorists, who quantify their loss function and perform the decision-theoretic calculations. This suggests that it is important to interact with users and to consider their goals. The cognitive research tells us that calibration is important for trust in probability forecasts, and that it is important to match the verbal expression with the task. The cognitive load should be minimized, reducing the probabilistic forecast to a single percentile if appropriate. Probabilities of adverse events and percentiles of the predictive distribution of quantities of interest seem often to be the best way to summarize probabilistic forecasts. Formal decision theory has an important role, but in a limited range of applications.},

abstract = {In the face of the apparent dispute in migration research about the effectiveness of migration policy, this paper scrutinizes the nature, evolution and effectiveness of immigration policies and provides an analytical framework for future research. In order to reduce analytical confusion and reconcile apparently conflicting views, this paper defines what constitutes migration policy and distinguishes policy effectiveness and policy effects. It identifies three policy gaps which can explain perceived or real policy failure. First, the ‘discourse gap' is the considerable discrepancy between the stated objectives of general public migration discourses and concrete policies. Second, the ‘implementation gap' is the disparity between policies on paper and their actual implementation. Third, the ‘efficacy' gap is the extent to which an implemented policy has the capacity to affect migration flows. The paper argues that studies should use concrete policies rather than public discourses as the evaluative benchmark. While we question the received idea that immigration policies have necessarily become more restrictive, available evidence suggests that migration policies have a significant effect on migration, but that the effect is limited compared to other migration determinants. Their effect might be further limited through various spatial, categorical and inter-temporal ‘substitution effects'. The paper hypothesizes that policies seem more effective in determining the selection and composition of migration rather than the overall volume and long-term trends of migration. However, robust evidence is still scarce and existing studies are generally unable to test for various ‘substitution effects'. The paper also suggests conceptual and methodological avenues for improving insights into policy effectiveness and effects. Keywords:},

We examine four of the most popular indices of inequality in this paper and contrast their performance as measures of spatial focus. Adopting the coefficient of variation as our preferred alternative, we go on to examine the spatial focus of aggregate interstate migration streams in the US over time. Then we consider disaggregations of the migration streams by age, race and nativity, and examine the role of states as national redistributors of these same subpopulations. We find that the migration patterns of the elderly, blacks, and the foreign-borns in general have exhibited levels of spatial focus that exceed those of their young adult, white, and native-born counterparts. With respect to the principal redistributor states, our findings for all subpopulations point to a very few states that persistently reappear in the group-specific classifications. In particular, California is a unique redistributor of the US population, always appearing as an extensive outward or inward redistributor of migrants.},

abstract = {With the development of China's economy since 1979, a new type of Chinese migration has emerged, which is more diversified and quite distinct from previ- ous migration patterns. Trafficking in human beings and other forms of irregular migration are one of the most pressing and complex human rights issues today, reaching across borders and affecting most of the countries in the world, with new and serious security implications. As part of the international irregular mi- gration flows toward and into the European Union (EU), the Chinese, particu- larly from Fujian and Zhejiang provinces, have played a major role since the 1980s. To some extent, it could be said that China provides the largest number of East Asian irregular immigrants to Europe. Based on fieldwork conducted in southern China over the past seven years, this paper proposes to examine current Chinese irregular migration trends. It will further present the Government's response regarding the migratory modus oper- andi and policy implications with the aim of offering policy makers an empirical insight into the most active region of emigration in China. Because of the diffi- culty and sensitivity involved in collecting data on the topic, materials in this paper are mainly based on a content analysis of local Chinese newspapers and my interviews with various people involved in irregular migration activities, such as “snakeheads”, illegal migrants and their family members, and police, local, and government officials at different levels.},

abstract = {International migration to developing countries has attracted increasing attention because of its growing volume in absolute terms and its potential contribution to development. However, conclusions about what is happening in these countries depend crucially on the way migration and development are measured and analysed. This article shows that whether migrant stocks appear to be increasing or decreasing in developing countries depends on three factors: whether a regional or an economic criterion of “development” is used, whether volume is expressed in absolute numbers or as a percentage of total population, and whether the data include refugees and asylum seekers. The policy implications of these findings, which – due to the shortcomings of available data – can only be regarded as provisional, are then discussed. Better quality migration data and analysis informed by the limitations of the data are needed to provide a sound evidence base for current debates about migration policy.},

@article{Faist2015,
abstract = {This book addresses environmental and climate change induced migration from the vantage point of migration studies, offering a broad spectrum of approaches for considering the environment/climate/migration nexus. Research on the subject is still frequently narrowed down to climate change vulnerability and the environmental push factor. The book establishes the interconnections between societal and environmental vulnerability, and migration and capability, allowing appreciation of migration in the frame of climate as a case of spatial and social mobility, that is, as a strategy of persons and groups to deal with a grossly unequal distribution of life chances across the world. In their introduction, the editors fan out the current debate and state the need to transcend predominantly policy-oriented approaches to migration. The first section of the volume focuses on "Methodologies and Methods" and presents very distinct approaches to think climate induced migration. Subsequent chapters explore the sensitivity of existing migration flows to climate change in Ghana and Bangladesh, the complex relationship between migration, demographic change and coping capacities in Canada, methodological challenges of a household survey on the significance of migration and remittances for adaptation in the Hindu Kush region and an econometric study of the aftermath of the 1998 floods in Bangladesh. The second part, "Areas of Concern: Politics and Human Rights", deepens the analysis of discourses as well as of the implications of proposed and implemented policies. Contributors discuss such topics as environmental migration as a multi-causal problem, climate migration as a consequence in an alarmist discourse and climate migration as a solution. A study of an integrated relocation program in Papua New Guinea is followed by chapters on the promise and the flaws of planned relocation policy, global policy on protection of environmental migrants including both internally displaced peoples and those who cross international borders. A concluding chapter places human agency at centre stage and explores the interplay between human rights, capability and migration.},

We attempt an empirically based critique of the merits and drawbacks of the use of social media data, in which the value of high spatial and temporal granularity of revealed activity patterns is contrasted with the paucity of individual attribute information. We apply new and novel methods to enrich the profiles of Twitter users in order to generalize about activity patterns in London, our case-study city. More insidious problems in the use of social media data arise from the as-yet-unknown sources and operation of bias in their user bases. Our contribution is to begin to identify and assess the biases inherent in social media usage in social research, and use these to evaluate their deployment in research applications.},

abstract = {Statistics on migration flows year by year within the UK are produced by the Office for National Statistics, the General Register Office for Scotland and the Northern Ireland Statistics Research Agency for migration within England and Wales, within Scotland and within Northern Ireland respectively. However, these flow statistics are not integrated across the UK. As there was a need for such integrated flow statistics at a sub-national scale known as NUTS2 for an EU sponsored project, the authors developed a synthetic estimate of migration flows for the calendar years 2000 to 2007 and the mid-year to midyear intervals 1999-2000 to 2006-07. The estimates were controlled by the migration flows published at NUTS1 scale from the UK wide NHS Central Register to which country specific flows between NUTS2 regions from the various patient registers were fitted. The gaps, flows between regions in different devolved territories, were filled by adjusting comprehensive flow data from the 2001 Census to the published NHSCR flows. Age detail was added only to the total out-migration and in-migration flows from each region using a fixed national profile of migration rates by age from the 2001 Census. The resulting time series of flow data provide, therefore, the three matrix faces of an origin-destination-age array for each time period. The paper describes the details of the estimation process and reports on some of the trends that the time series show.},

The chapters in this volume are grouped according to the main themes of rethinking population forecasting. The first chapter investigates the accuracy of the UN world population forecasts while the second and third chapters deal with increasing the dimensionality of population forecasts. The fourth and fifth chapters deal with building population-forecasting models into broader models. The sixth and seventh chapters discuss new developments in probabilistic population forecasting describing it as the most phenomenal development in the field of population forecasting. The authors explore the usefulness of combining expert opinion and statistical approaches drawing on an interacting group of experts for information on uncertainty. Producing population forecasts from models of probabilistic population renewal is also argued deriving information on future uncertainty from errors in past forecasts. Finally the eighth chapter presents new developments in population forecasting that should be pursued.},

Previous attempts to map the flows between origins and destinations have suffered from problems of occlusion usually requiring some form of generalisation, such as aggregation or flow density estimation before they can be visualized. This can lead to loss of detail or the introduction of arbitrary artefacts in the visual representation. Here, we propose mapping OD vectors as cells rather than lines, comparable with the process of constructing OD matrices, but unlike the OD matrix, we preserve the spatial layout of all origin and destination locations by constructing a gridded two-level spatial treemap. The result is a set of spatially ordered small multiples upon which any arbitrary geographic data may be projected. Using a hash grid spatial data structure, we explore the characteristics of the technique through a software prototype that allows interactive query and visualisation of 105–106 simulated and recorded OD vectors. The technique is illustrated using US county to county migration and commuting statistics.},

Whether to be reconsidered or not, whether to result in a stronger or diminished UK and EU, analysts pouring over the voting data have identified key trends in the UK around generation, locality, income and education. But in particular there appears a complete public misunderstanding of the net contribution made by migrants to the UK. As Fukyama's (1992, 2014) insightful analysis has long pointed out the transition from place based industrial work to mobile service work would threaten democratic regimes. The educated population required to capitalise on technological advances, would use their education to question current systems of governance. In addition, lower transportation and communications costs would enable hundreds of millions of low skilled workers to enter the global labour market, driving down the wages and potential living standards of those workers in developed countries. While the place based working class might be organised as a political force, in particular through workers organisation such as trade unions, the mobile workforce – increasingly in the informal sector – were hard to politicise. In addition is the destruction of local community. In a capitalist globalised world, traditional communities based on locality are threatened by the growing numbers of educated mobile people who live in communities where they did not grow up or where their families lived before them. This thesis is clear to see here in UK 2016. A country in transition still retaining large numbers of place based individuals in towns and rural areas – generally less well educated and travelled due to the constraints of age and socio-economic background.

abstract = {The Bayesian approach has a number of attractive properties for probabilistic forecasting. In this paper, we apply Bayesian time series models to obtain future population estimates with uncertainty for England and Wales. To account for heterogeneity found in the historical data, we add parameters to represent the stochastic volatility in the error terms. Uncertainty in model choice is incorporated through Bayesian model averaging techniques. The resulting predictive distributions from Bayesian forecasting models have two main advantages over those obtained using traditional stochastic models. Firstly, data and uncertainties in the parameters and model choice are explicitly included using probability distributions. As a result, more realistic probabilistic population forecasts can be obtained. Second, Bayesian models formally allow the incorporation of expert opinion, including uncertainty, into the forecast. Our results are discussed in relation to classical time series methods and existing cohort component projections. This paper demonstrates the flexibility of the Bayesian approach to simple population forecasting and provides insights into further developments of more complicated population models that include, for example, components of demographic change.},

abstract = {The EM algorithm is a numerical technique for the evaluation of maximum
likelihood estimates for parameters describing incomplete data models.
It is easy to apply in many problems and is stable but slow. The
algorithm fails to provide a consistent estimator of the standard
errors of the maximum likelihood estimates unless the additional
analysis required by the Louis method is performed. Newton-type or
other gradient methods are faster and provide error estimates but
tend to be unstable and require the analytical evaluation of likelihoods
to derive expressions for the score function and (at least) approximations
to the Fisher information matrix. The purpose of this paper is to
expand on a result by Fisher that permits a unification of EM methodology
and Newton methods. The evaluation of the individual observation-by-observation
score functions of the incomplete data is a by-product of the application
of the E step of the EM algorithm. Once these become available, the
Fisher information matrix may be consistently estimated, and the
M step may be replaced by a fast Newton-type step.},

abstract = {The relationship between population distribution and resources, environment and social-economic development has a significant influence on the human development. This paper set up a set of index system and model methods for the assessment of the coordination between population and resources, environment and social-economic development, and it quantitatively evaluated this coordination at the provincial scale in 2000 and 2010 respectively. Based on this set of index system, the suitability degree and the spatial-temporal pattern of population distribution at the provincial scale were carefully characterized. The restriction of population distribution at the provincial scale was graded and classified, and the coordinated development strategy of population, resources, environment and social economy was finally put forward. The results showed that: (1) The environmental suitability of population distribution at the provincial scale was generally high in China, which tended to be stable from 2000 to 2010. (2) The restriction of water and land resources at the provincial scale was generally strong in China, but it tended to be weak from 2000 to 2010. (3) The coordination degree between the social-economic development and population distribution at the provincial scale was mostly at a middle level, which was in the positive upward path from 2000 to 2010. (4) The suitability of population distribution at the provincial scale was mostly at a middle level, all of which was rising from 2000 to 2010. (5) The coordination degree between population distribution and resources, environment and social-economic development at the provincial scale was divided into four grades, including basic coordination, relative coordination, awaited coordination and urgent-needed coordination. (6) The basic ways to promote the coordinated development of population, resources and environment in different regions in China can be summarized as: implementing the strategy of population agglomeration and evacuation, guiding the orderly flow of population, optimizing the spatial distribution of population and drawing up the spatial planning of population development. {\textcopyright} 2014 Science in China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

This paper offers a first quantification of the levels of environmental migration to the United Kingdom that might be expected. The authors apply Bijak and Wi{\'{s}}niowski's (2010) methodology for forecasting migration using Bayesian models. They seek to advance the conceptual understanding of forecasting in three ways. First, the paper is believed to be the first time that the Bayesian modelling approach has been attempted in relation to environmental mobility. Second, the paper examines the plausibility of Bayesian modelling of UK immigration by cross - checking expert responses to a Delphi survey with the expectations about environmental mobility evident in the recent research literature. Third, the values and assumptions of the expert evidence provided in the Delphi survey are interrogated to illustrate the limited set of conditions under which the forecasts of environmental mobility, as set out in this paper, are likely to hold.},

The overall performance of a migration model is evaluated with the contribution of all explanatory variables, including regional attributes and spatial interaction effects. This research uses a new method to estimate migration modeling errors by their sources. Following the notion of migration spatial structure, the observed or estimated regional migration matrices of a migration system can be described by four factors: the overall effect, the relative emissiveness and the relative attractiveness of specific regions, and the effect of spatial interaction between pairs of regions. By calculating the contributions of migration factors to the modeling error, this article reveals which factors of the migration process can be modeled more or less accurately using the case of regional migration in China for the period between 2005 and 2010.

There are several sources of income expressed as gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, but there are no time series that are complete for the years between 1950 and 2015 for the 210 countries for which data exist. It is in the interest of population health research to establish a global time series that is complete from 1950 to 2015.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: We collected GDP per capita estimates expressed in either constant US dollar terms or international dollar terms (corrected for purchasing power parity) from seven sources. We applied several stages of models, including ordinary least-squares regressions and mixed effects models, to complete each of the seven source series from 1950 to 2015. The three US dollar and four international dollar series were each averaged to produce two new GDP per capita series.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Nine complete series from 1950 to 2015 for 210 countries are available for use. These series can serve various analytical purposes and can illustrate myriad economic trends and features. The derivation of the two new series allows for researchers to avoid any series-specific biases that may exist. The modeling approach used is flexible and will allow for yearly updating as new estimates are produced by the source series.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: GDP per capita is a necessary tool in population health research, and our development and implementation of a new method has allowed for the most comprehensive known time series to date.},

The Random Waypoint (RWP) and Erdos-Renyi (ER) models have been a popular choice among researchers for generating mobility traces of nodes and relationships between them. Not only RWP and ER are useful in evaluating networking protocols in a simulation environment, but they are also used for theoretical analysis of such dynamic networks. However, it has been observed that neither relationships among people nor their movements are random. Instead, human movements frequently contain repeated patterns and friendship is bounded by distance. We used social networking site Gowalla to collect, create and validate models of human mobility and relationships for analysis and evaluations of applications in opportunistic networks such as sensor networks and transportation models in civil engineering. In doing so, we hope to provide more human-like movements and social relationship models to researchers to study problems in complex and mobile networks.},

abstract = {This paper reviews theoretical ideas accounting for the supply of international migrants, the demand for their services, the motivations of movers, the infrastructure that connects sources of migrant supply and demand, and the intent and efficacy of state policies to regulate cross-border movements of people. These ideas offer a guide for the construction of improved forecasting models. The supply of international migrants is likely to be determined by transitions to the market now occurring throughout the developing world, and destinations will reflect links of trade, transportation, politics, and communication between developing and developed nations. The demand for immigrants in the latter is connected to the segmentation of labor markets and those persons who respond to these structural forces by becoming international migrants will be motivated by diverse goals, including the desire to overcome failures in capital, credit, and insurance markets as well as disequilibria in labor markets. In modeling migration it is imperative to estimate the influence of migrant networks and to capture the feedback effects of networks over time. The parameterization of such feedbacks according to a logistic function would enable forecasting models to do a better job of capturing the dynamic effects of migrant networks in promoting future immigration based on past experience.},

This article discusses the experience and benefits of adopting this new approach, including the perspective of a key user of projections, the New Zealand Treasury. Our experience is that the change is less difficult to make than might be expected. Uncertainty in the different projection inputs (components) can be modelled simply or with more complexity, and progressively applied to different projection types. This means that not all the different demographic projections an agency produces need to adopt a stochastic approach simultaneously. At the same time, users of the projections are keen to better understand the relative certainty and uncertainty of projected outcomes, given the important uses of projections.},

abstract = {During the last ten years, a large body of research extracting and analysing geographic data from social media has developed. We analyse 690 papers across 20 social media platforms, focussing particularly on the method used for extraction of location information. We discuss and compare extraction methods, and consider their accuracy and coverage. While much work has adopted location information in the form of coordinates in message metadata, this approach has very limited coverage in most platforms and reports on posting location rather than message location or the location that the message refers to (geofocus). In contrast, a wide array of other approaches have been developed, with methods that extract place names from message text providing the highest accuracy. Methods that use social media connections also provide good results, but all of the methods have limitations. We also present analysis of the range and frequency of use of different social media platforms, and the wide range of application areas that have been addressed. Drawing on this analysis we present a number of future areas of research that warrant attention in order for this field of research to mature.},

abstract = {E. G. Ravenstein's three articles on migration, the first published one hundred years ago, form the basis for most modern research on migration; if the three articles are collated, his "laws" or perhaps more accurately, hypotheses, total eleven. This article considers, briefly, Ravenstein's career, the sources on which his "laws" were based and some of the difficulties of interpreting the British Census place of birth data. The bulk of the article reviews subsequent work on his eleven hypotheses with reference to nineteenth-century British internal migration. Subsequent work has confirmed that migration was mainly short distance and that there was relatively little increase in the average distance travelled by migrants until after 1850. His step-by-step hypothesis remains untested, but his belief that most migration was from the countryside to the towns is confirmed as is his identification of counter currents. His ideas on sex and age differentials have been borne out. However, his assumptions about the relative importance of natural increase and migration in the growth of cities and the relative importance of "push" and "pull" factors in causing migration merit further research. His original hypotheses have for the most part been confirmed. However, the defects of the published data suggest that nineteenth-century migration will not be properly understood until the enumerators' schedules for the century have been analysed. {\textcopyright} 1977.},

abstract = {This paper provides a review of the literature on the development impact of migration and remittances on origin countries and on destination countries in the South. International migration is an ever-growing phenomenon that has important development implications for both sending and receiving countries. For a sending country, migration and the resulting remittances lead to increased incomes and poverty reduction, and improved health and educational outcomes, and promote economic development. Yet these gains might come at substantial social costs to the migrants and their families. Since many developing countries are also large recipients of international migrants, they face challenges of integration of immigrants, job competition between migrant and native workers, and fiscal costs associated with provision of social services to the migrants. This paper also summarizes incipient discussions on the impacts of migration on climate change, democratic values, demographics, national identity, and security. In conclusion, the paper highlights a few policy recommendations calling for better integration of migration in development policies in the South and the North, improving data collection on migration and remittance flows, leveraging remittances for improving access to finance of recipient households and countries, improving recruitment mechanisms, and facilitating international labor mobility through safe and legal channels.},

abstract = {This paper proposes an extension of the standard parameterized model migration schedule to account for highly age-concentrated student migration. Many age profiles of regional migration are characterized by sudden ‘spiked' increases in migration intensities in the late teenage years, which are related to leaving school, and, in particular, to entry into higher education. The standard model schedule does not appear to be effective in describing the pattern at these ages. This paper therefore proposes anextension of the standard model through the addition of a student curve. The paper also describes a relatively simple Microsoft Excel-based fitting procedure. By way of illustration, both student peak and standard model schedules are fitted to the age patterns of internal migration for two Australian regions that experience substantial student migration. The student peak schedule is shown to provide an improved model of these migration age profiles. Illustrative population projections are presented to demonstrate the differences that result when model migration schedules with and without student peaks are used},

This paper argues that the reality of international movements is more complex. Thus, the aim of our analysis is to shed light on the diversity of migration patterns involving repeat movements between origin and destination and multiple migration, which encompass more than one destination country within its migration trajectory. A review of the literature points to the gap between the literature on repeat migration and that on multiple migration. These two strands of literature developed separately; each took as a frame of reference one-off migration. In this paper we bridge this theoretical gap. Empirical analysis, based on the European Internal Movers' Social Survey (EIMSS), quantifies the volume of one-off, repeat and multiple movements between selected European Union countries. The study also points to how the diverse patterns of migration are socially structured.},

abstract = {In Canada, unlike many other countries, birth-residence data by age and sex are available in each of the decennial censuses from 1931 to 1961 which permit the estimation of intercensal net migration for the provinces and regions. After a brief discussion of the basic measures of migration from birth-residence data the paper focusses on the problems and procedures in estimating interprovincial net migration, 1951–1961 for Canada using “the place of birth survival ratio method, ” and it evaluates the estimates thus obtained. The evaluation of the estimates, taking into consideration the inherent limitations of the method and its merits compared with period migration estimates by the census survival ratio method and life table survival ratio method, suggests that the net migration estimates for the Canadian born by the place of birth survival ratio method are probably more reliable than those by the other two methods. One striking finding was that the net migration curves by age obtained from the census survival ratio and place of birth survival ratio estimates were smoother than the curve obtained with the use of the more accurate life table survival ratios. Furthermore, whatever the relative accuracy of net migration may be, the birth-residence approach is capable of furnishing more details about the net migration of the native born than by the standard survival-ratio methods. For the population under age 10 intercensal estimates were directly derived from the place of birth and residence distributions by age.},

We combine a unique new data set of annual bilateral high-skilled immigration labour flows for 10 OECD destinations between 2000 and 2012, with new databases comprising both unilateral and bilateral policy instruments, to examine which types, and combinations, of policies are most effective in attracting and selecting high skilled workers using a micro-founded gravity framework. Points-based systems are much more effective in attracting and selecting high-skilled migrants in comparison with requiring a job offer, labour market tests or working in shortage-listed occupations. Financial incentives yield better outcomes in ‘demand-driven' systems than when combined with points-based systems however. Offers of permanent residency, while attracting the highly skilled, overall reduce the human capital content of labour flows since they prove more attractive to non-high skilled workers. Bilateral recognition of diploma and social security agreements, foster greater flows of high skilled workers and improve the skill selectivity of immigrant flows. Conversely, double taxation agreements deter high-skilled migrants, although they do not alter the overall skill selectivity. Higher skilled wages increase the number and skill selectivity of labour flows, whereas higher levels of unemployment exert the opposite effects. Migrant networks, contiguous borders, common language and freedom of movement, while encouraging greater numbers of high skilled workers, exert greater effects on non-high skilled workers, thereby reducing the skill content of labour flows. Greater geographic distances however, while deterring both types of workers, affect the high skilled less, thereby improving the selection on skills. Our results are robust to a variety of empirical specifications, accounting for destination-specific amenities, multilateral resistance to migration and the endogeneity of immigration policies.},

abstract = {Summary Probabilistic population forecasts are useful because they describe uncertainty in a quantitatively useful way. One approach (that we call LT) uses historical data to estimate stochastic models (e.g., a time series model) of vital rates, and then makes forecasts. Another (we call it RS) began as a kind of randomized scenario: we consider its simplest variant, in which expert opinion is used to make probability distributions for terminal vital rates, and smooth trajectories are followed over time. We use analysis and examples to show several key differences between these methods: serial correlations in the forecast are much smaller in LT; the variance in LT models of vital rates (especially fertility) is much higher than in RS models that are based on official expert scenarios; trajectories in LT are much more irregular than in RS; probability intervals in LT tend to widen faster over forecast time. Newer versions of RS have been developed that reduce or eliminate some of these differences.

abstract = {We quantified determinants of international migratory inflows to
17 Western countries and outflows from 13 of these countries between
1950 and 2007 in 77,658 observations from multiple sources using
panel-data analysis techniques. To construct a quantitative model
that could be useful for demographic projection, we analyzed the
logarithm of the number of migrants (inflows and outflows separately)
as dependent variables in relation to demographic, geographic, and
social independent variables. The independent variables most influential
on log inflows were demographic [log population of origin and destination
and log infant mortality rate (IMR) of origin and destination] and
geographic (log distance between capitals and log land area of the
destination). Social and historical determinants were less influential.
For log outflows from the 13 countries, the most influential independent
variables were log population of origin and destination, log IMR
of destination, and log distance between capitals. A young age structure
in the destination was associated with lower inflows while a young
age structure in the origin was associated with higher inflows. Urbanization
in destination and origin increased international migration. IMR
affected inflows and outflows significantly but oppositely. Being
landlocked, having a common border, having the same official language,
sharing a minority language, and colonial links also had statistically
significant but quantitatively smaller effects on international migration.
Comparisons of models with different assumed correlation structures
of residuals indicated that independence was the best assumption,
supporting the use of ordinary-least-squares estimation techniques
to obtain point estimates of coefficients.},

We consider multiple types of human conflict, including both interpersonal conflict, such as assault and murder, and intergroup conflict, including riots and civil war. We discuss key methodological issues in estimating causal relationships and largely focus on natural experiments that exploit variation in climate over time. Using a hierarchical meta-analysis that allows us to both estimate the mean effect and quantify the degree of variability across 55 studies, we find that deviations from moderate temperatures and precipitation patterns systematically increase conflict risk. Contemporaneous temperature has the largest average impact, with each 1$\sigma$ increase in temperature increasing interpersonal conflict by 2.4{\%} and intergroup conflict by 11.3{\%}. We conclude by highlighting research priorities, including a better understanding of the mechanisms linking climate to conflict, societies' ability to adapt to climatic changes, and the likely impacts of future global warming.},

abstract = {This study examined international migration trends during 1965-96, by region, for 218 countries in 1985. Data were obtained from UN databases of national censuses. Findings indicate that migrants increased from 75 to 120 million during 1965-90 (an annual growth rate of 1.9{\%}). The number of international tourists rose from 69 to 454 million during this period. The growth rate of tourists has declined over time, while the growth rate of international migrants has increased over time. Variation between countries in the proportion of international migrants increased over time. Women's participation in international migration rose slightly from 46.6{\%} to 47.7{\%} during 1965-90. 90{\%} of the migrant stock was concentrated in 55 countries in 1990, an increase from 44 countries in 1965. The changes are attributed potentially to growing diversification of countries in level of development, their stage in the nation building process, and the degree of integration in the global economy. The market economy industrialized countries have absorbed a disproportionate share of the migrant stock, while experiencing declines in their share of global population. One out of every 13 persons living in the West is an international migrant. Net migration rates vary widely between Western countries. The number of persons seeking asylum in the West increased during the 1980s and in traditional countries of immigration. Some countries were the main sources of migrants to 7 receiving countries during 1990-94. Origins and destinations have diversified in all regions since 1965, and trends can change quickly.},

Geo coded Twitter data, in particular, has been shown to be a promising source to analyse large scale human migration. But given the scale of these datasets, a lot of manual effort has to be put into processing and getting actionable insights from this data. In this paper, we explore feasibility of using a new tool, tensor decomposition, to understand trends in global human migration. We model human migration as a three mode tensor, consisting of (origin country, destination country, time of migration) and apply CP decomposition to get meaningful low dimensional factors. Our experiments on a large Twitter dataset spanning 5 years and over 100M tweets show that we can extract meaningful migration patterns.},

abstract = {S-PLUS is a powerful environment for the statistical and graphical analysis of data. It provides the tools to implement many statistical ideas which have been made possible by the widespread availability of workstations having good graphics and computational capabilities. This book is a guide to using S-PLUS to perform statistical analyses and provides both an introduction to the use of S-PLUS and a course in modern statistical methods. S-PLUS is available for both Windows and UNIX workstations, and both versions are covered in depth. The aim of the book is to show how to use S-PLUS as a powerful and graphical data analysis system. Readers are assumed to have a basic grounding in statistics, and so the book in intended for would-be users of S-PLUS and both students and researchers using statistics. Throughout, the emphasis is on presenting practical problems and full analyses of real data sets. Many of the methods discussed are state-of-the-art approaches to topics such as linear, nonlinear, and smooth regression models, tree-based methods, multivariate analysis and pattern recognition, survival analysis, time series and spatial statistics. Throughout, modern techniques such as robust methods, non-parametric smoothing, and bootstrapping are used where appropriate. This third edition is intended for users of S-PLUS 4.5, 5.0, 2000 or later, although S-PLUS 3.3/4 are also considered. The major change from the second edition is coverage of the current versions of S-PLUS. The material has been extensively rewritten using new examples and the latest computationally intensive methods. The companion volume on S Programming will provide an in-depth guide for those writing software in the S language. The authors have written several software libraries that enhance S-PLUS; these and all the datasets used are available on the Internet in versions for Windows and UNIX. There are extensive on-line complements covering advanced material, user-contributed extensions, further exercises, and new features of S-PLUS as they are introduced. Dr. Venables is now Statistician with CSRIO in Queensland, having been at the Department of Statistics, University of Adelaide, for many years previously. He has given many short courses on S-PLUS in Australia, Europe, and the USA. Professor Ripley holds the Chair of Applied Statistics at the University of Oxford, and is the author of four other books on spatial statistics, simulation, pattern recognition, and neural networks.},

abstract = {Migration is a top political priority for the European Union (EU). Data on international migrant stocks and flows are essential for effective migration management. In this report, we estimated the number of expatriates in 17 EU countries based on the number of Facebook Network users who are classified by Facebook as “expats”. To this end, we proposed a method for correcting the over- or under representativeness of Facebook Network users compared to countries' actual population. This method uses Facebook penetration rates by age group and gender in the country of previous residence and country of destination of a Facebook expat. The purpose of Facebook Network expat estimations is not to reproduce migration statistics, but rather to generate separate estimates of expatriates, since migration statistics and Facebook Network expats estimates do not measure the same quantities of interest. Estimates of social media application users who are classified as expats can be a timely, low-cost, and almost globally available source of information for estimating stocks of international migrants. Our methodology allowed for the timely capture of the increase of Venezuelan migrants in Spain. However, there are important methodological and data integrity issues with using social media data sources for studying migration-related phenomena. For example, our methodology led us to significantly overestimate the number of expats from Philippines in Spain and in Italy and there is no evidence that this overestimation may be valid. While research on the use of big data sources for migration is in its infancy, and the diffusion of internet technologies in less developed countries is still limited, the use of big data sources can unveil useful insights on quantitative and qualitative characteristics of migration.},

abstract = {Vacation planning is one of the frequent-but nonetheless laborious-tasks that people engage themselves with online; requiring skilled interaction with a multitude of resources. This paper constructs intra-city travel itineraries automatically by tapping a latent source reflecting geo-temporal breadcrumbs left by millions of tourists. For example, the popular rich media sharing site, Flickr, allows photos to be stamped by the time of when they were taken and be mapped to Points Of Interests (POIs) by geographical (i.e. latitudelongitude) and semantic (e.g., tags) metadata. Leveraging this information, we construct itineraries following a two-step approach. Given a city, we first extract photo streams of individual users. Each photo stream provides estimates on where the user was, how long he stayed at each place, and what was the transit time between places. In the second step, we aggregate all user photo streams into a POI graph. Itineraries are then automatically constructed from the graph based on the popularity of the POIs and subject to the user's time and destination constraints. We evaluate our approach by constructing itineraries for several major cities and comparing them, through a "crowdsourcing" marketplace (Amazon Mechanical Turk), against itineraries constructed from popular bus tours that are professionally generated. Our extensive survey-based user studies over about 450 workers on AMT indicate that high quality itineraries can be automatically constructed from Flickr data.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2017. Although cross-cultural research suggests that the development and functionality of secondary coping strategies are substantially influenced by the broader cultural context, research findings are not completely conclusive. Some studies indicate that secondary coping is more adaptive for Asian participants compared with Westerners, while others emphasize the adaptability of the coping style in Asian, but not Western, contexts. The main objective of the present study was to systematically test for ethnic and contextual differences in the effectiveness of secondary strategies (measured in the form of acceptance and positive reinterpretation) in reducing the negati ve effects of acculturative stress on somatic symptoms with samples of international students. A 3-month longitudinal study was conducted in two different contexts: (a) Asian and Western international students in China (Asians: n = 53, Westerners: n = 51) and (b) similar groups in New Zealand (Asians: n = 61, Westerners: n = 65). The data were subjected to a hierarchical regression analysis with changes in psychological symptoms functioning as the dependent variable. Findings indicated that stress, secondary coping, and cultural context significantly interacted in predicting changes in somatic symptoms. Specifically, secondary coping exacerbated the negative effects of acculturative stress on psychological adjustment in New Zealand. In contrast, secondary coping functioned as a buffer in China, such that it was effective at reducing the negative impact of stress over time. Findings indicated that ethnicity did not significantly moderate the stress–coping–adjustment relationship. Our results show that the effectiveness of secondary coping varies as a function of the cultural context.},

We argue that the value of the rural registration influences migrants' decision-making and identities by creating a cost to registration transfer to the city, and that the rural land system interacts with the household registration system to inhibit migrant integration. We test novel hypotheses derived from a simple model of migrant integration, finding connections between rural sending area factors and migrant integration in the city. We test these hypotheses using survey data from two surveys of rural-to-urban migrant workers and publicly available economic data. We find that migrants from areas with higher levels of economic development are less likely to desire registration transfer to the city. We also find that landholding and weaker rural and rights are associated with lower levels of social integration in the city.},

abstract = {Numerical weather prediction ensembles are routinely used for operational weather forecasting. The members of these ensembles are individual simulations with either slightly perturbed initial conditions or different model parameterizations, or occasionally both. Multi-member ensemble output is usually large, multivariate, and challenging to interpret interactively. Forecast meteorologists are interested in understanding the uncertainties associated with numerical weather prediction; specifically variability between the ensemble members. Currently, visualization of ensemble members is mostly accomplished through spaghetti plots of a single mid-troposphere pressure surface height contour. In order to explore new uncertainty visualization methods, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model was used to create a 48-hour, 18 member parameterization ensemble of the 13 March 1993 "Superstorm". A tool was designed to interactively explore the ensemble uncertainty of three important weather variables: water-vapor mixing ratio, perturbation potential temperature, and perturbation pressure. Uncertainty was quantified using individual ensemble member standard deviation, inter-quartile range, and the width of the 95{\%} confidence interval. Bootstrapping was employed to overcome the dependence on normality in the uncertainty metrics. A coordinated view of ribbon and glyph-based uncertainty visualization, spaghetti plots, iso-pressure colormaps, and data transect plots was provided to two meteorologists for expert evaluation. They found it useful in assessing uncertainty in the data, especially in finding outliers in the ensemble run and therefore avoiding the WRF parameterizations that lead to these outliers. Additionally, the meteorologists could identify spatial regions where the uncertainty was significantly high, allowing for identification of poorly simulated storm environments and physical interpretation of these model issues.},

@article{Billari2014,
abstract = {This article suggests a procedure to derive stochastic population forecasts adopting an expert-based approach. As in previous work by Billari et al. (2012), experts are required to provide evaluations, in the form of conditional and unconditional scenarios, on summary indicators of the demographic components determining the population evolution: that is, fertility, mortality, and migration. Here, two main purposes are pursued. First, the demographic components are allowed to have some kind of dependence. Second, as a result of the existence of a body of shared information, possible correlations among experts are taken into account. In both cases, the dependence structure is not imposed by the researcher but rather is indirectly derived through the scenarios elicited from the experts. To address these issues, the method is based on a mixture model, within the so-called Supra-Bayesian approach, according to which expert evaluations are treated as data. The derived posterior distribution for the demographic indicators of interest is used as forecasting distribution, and a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm is designed to approximate this posterior. This article provides the questionnaire designed by the authors to collect expert opinions. Finally, an application to the forecast of the Italian population from 2010 to 2065 is proposed.},

abstract = {We consider the problem of online prediction when it is uncertain what the best prediction model to use is. We develop a method called Dynamic Model Averaging (DMA) in which a state space model for the parameters of each model is combined with a Markov chain model for the correct model. This allows the "correct" model to vary over time. The state space and Markov chain models are both specified in terms of forgetting, leading to a highly parsimonious representation. As a special case, when the model and parameters do not change, DMA is a recursive implementation of standard Bayesian model averaging, which we call recursive model averaging. The method is applied to the problem of predicting the output strip thickness for a cold rolling mill, where the output is measured with a time delay. We found that when only a small number of physically motivated models were considered and one was clearly best, the method quickly converged to the best model, and the cost of model uncertainty was small; indeed DMA performed slightly better than the best physical model. When model uncertainty and the number of models considered were large, our method ensured that the penalty for model uncertainty was small. At the beginning of the process, when control is most difficult, we found that DMA over a large model space led to better predictions than the single best performing physically motivated model. We also applied the method to several simulated examples, and found that it recovered both constant and time-varying regression parameters and model specifications quite well.},

However, the sharp post-2000 decline in the non-imputed interstate migration rate in the Current Population Survey (CPS), which has received considerable attention, is not reflected in other available data. In this paper, we use administrative records data to investigate labor mobility and migration within the U.S. We investigate the discrepancy in recent migration trends in the CPS and migration rates derived from administrative records sources using CPS micro data linked to administrative records on residential location. We find that a substantial fraction of CPS respondents who are cross-state migrants in the administrative records data do not report a cross-state move in the CPS, and that this disagreement has grown over time. Despite this disagreement in recent trends in overall interstate migration, rates and trends related to economic migration are remarkably similar in available data sources.},

The study aims at analyzing the "pull" forces of Yiwu City and developing migration models for understanding determinants factors of population migration/floating into Yiwu City from other areas in China. The spatial layout of Yiwu's pull forces is proved as a V-shaped pattern consisting of the two axes by using explorative spatial data analysis and map visualization method. The migration models with (model 3) or without (model 2) migration stock are presented and estimated using standard linear regression model, spatial error model as well as spatial lag model at the county scale in Jiangxi province. Based on the likelihood statistics, the AIC and the Moran's I statistics of residuals, the model with migration stock provides an improved fit over the model without migration stock. The correlation between migration ratio and man land ratio is significant at the 0.5 level according to estimates of model 3 and spatial version of model 2. All the three estimates of model 2 and the OLS results of model 3 confirm the distance-decay effect while results from the spatial version of model 3 failed to support the distance rule in population floating. Contrary to the previous studies at the provincial level, the correlation between per capital net income of rural labor forces and migration ratio is not significant according to the three versions of the two models due to the small disparities of income within the counties in Jiangxi. Examination of specification tests in spatial version of model 3 indicates that there is less significant spatial error dependence in the spatial lag models than spatial lag dependence in the error models, further suggesting a preference for the lag model. Model 2 does not suggest any preference for choosing spatial error model and spatial lag model. ?? 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2019, Springer Nature B.V. The present study empirically analyzes determinants of immigration to EU member countries for the period 1998–2016. By performing PPML regression, it investigates the dynamics of different political and economic determinants. In general, there are two opposing effects: better living conditions in the origin country increase the feasibility of migration (feasibility hypothesis), but they also decrease international differentials, thus diminishing the incentive to migrate (incentive hypothesis). Indeed, better economic conditions in the origin country ease the budget constraints of potential migrants and thereby stimulate emigration to EU countries (feasibility hypothesis). At the same time, the income differential between destination and origin country is also positively related to migration, supporting the incentive hypothesis. Contrary to these findings about economic determinants, the impact of political determinants is only robust in one direction, for migration from outside the EU. Here, worse political conditions in the origin country increase the need to migrate, causing flight migration (need hypothesis). Altogether, economic determinants appear to outweigh political factors.},

We propose an adaptation of the multiplicative component model framework to first estimate total immigration and total emigration for each ASEAN country from 2000 to 2015, borrowing information from 34 other countries in the world. Second, bilateral flows are estimated using a range of auxiliary information on the interactions among ASEAN countries and constraining them to the total immigration and total emigration estimates.

@article{Bernard2014a,
abstract = {Migration is an age-selective process, with young adults being the most mobile group. The propensity to migrate typically peaks at young adult ages, then steadily declines with increasing age, rising again among young chil-dren and sometimes around the age of retirement. Rogers and Castro (1981) demonstrated that this broad age profile is replicated, with some variations, in a variety of countries and at various spatial scales. Despite these persistent regularities, recent cross-national studies have revealed systematic variations in the age profile of migration, particularly at young adult ages. Previous studies have sought to explain variations in migration age profiles within a country by linking migration ages to factors such as educa-tion participation (Warnes 1992a), demographic cycles (Milne 1993; Pandit 1997b), and economic conditions (Pandit 1997a; Plane and Rogerson 1991). Another line of inquiry has relied on self-reported reasons for moving to explore variations in migration ages (Bogue, Liegel, and Kozloski 2009; Rog-ers and Castro 1979). There is also a growing literature on the connection between migration and particular transitions in the life course, commonly using event-history analysis (Mulder, Clark, and Wagner 2002).While this work has delivered valuable insights into the factors that trigger migration, it has not established how these forces interact to shape migration age profiles. Also missing is any compelling evidence about which factors are common across countries and which ones are country-specific. A distinctive line of research examines the age variation in migration streams between regions within individual countries, but our focus here is on the aggregate propensity to move within a country. To address these gaps, we propose a conceptual framework, adapted from Bongaarts's model of fertility (1978), that links contextual factors to the age structure of internal migration through intermediate variables, or 2 1 4 a g e P r o f i l e o f i n t e r n a l M i g r a t i o n proximate determinants, that directly affect the ages at which migration oc-curs. We suggest that the wider socioeconomic context has an indirect effect on migration age profiles by shaping the structure and timing of life-course transitions, which in turn determine migration behavior. We argue, therefore, that cross-national differences in migration age profiles are likely to reflect variations in the age structure of life-course transitions. These transitions represent the proximate determinants of migration. We test this proposition by establishing the association between migra-tion age profiles and the age structure of four key life-course transitions— education completion, labor force entry, union formation, and first childbear-ing—across a global sample of countries. This work forms part of the IMAGE project (Internal Migration Around the Globe—http://www.gpem.uq.edu. au/image), which aims to develop and apply statistical indicators of internal migration that can be used to make comparisons between countries across several dimensions, including age, and explain cross-national variations (Bell et al. 2014). To establish the association between the age profiles of migration and the age profiles of life-course transitions, we select two sets of indicators. We use age at peak migration and migration intensity at the peak to summarize the age profile of migration (Bernard, Bell, and Charles-Edwards 2014), and we use the prevalence, timing, and spread of transitions to adulthood to gauge the structure of the life course (Modell, Furstenberg, and Hershberg 1976; Hogan 1981; Billari and Wilson 2001). We compute the selected metrics for 27 countries and use scatter plots and correlation analysis to identify the extent of global and regional variations. We then use factor analysis to gauge the joint impact of the four life-course transitions on migration by creating indexes of timing and spread. We implement the proposed metrics to identify countries where migration age profiles are strongly associated with the age structure of the life course. In the following sections we propose the conceptual framework linking migration age profiles to life-course transitions and contextual factors; pres-ent evidence on cross-national variations in the age structure of life-course transitions; define a suite of metrics that gauge the age profiles of life-course transitions and migration; and apply these summary measures to 27 coun-tries to identify the extent of cross-national variations in the age structure of the life course and establish its association with migration age profiles. We conclude with recommendations for cross-national comparisons of migration age profiles and directions for future work. The proximate determinants of migration age profiles},

abstract = {Migration has become a key factor in the growth and replacement of populations. But demographic tools for its analysis remain simple. This paper is our response to those problems. We propose a set of simple, single-number indicators, which summarise the aggregate effect of the major contributing factors to the reproduction of populations. Our estimates imply that the persistence of rates observed since 2004 would lead to robust population growth in the North-Western and Northern economically developed European countries. On the other hand, countries in the East of the EU and Central European countries would face substantial population decline due both to their low fertility and to low or negative net migration. If current inflows and fertility levels persist, then within 50 years, people who migrated after 2004 and their descendants will comprise more than half of the population at childbearing and younger ages in some European countries.

We begin with a brief discussion of diasporas and pre- sent some recent data on the larger of the non-Chinese diasporas to enable us to better evaluate the significance and importance of the Chinese diaspora. We then review the major patterns of previous Chinese emigrations to provide an overall perspective for the presentation of our empirical data on overseas Chinese. This is followed by a discussion of our data and its sources. We then present and analyze our current data on overseas Chinese for the period c. 2010–2011 and answer our four questions.},

It is shown that internal migration data can be usefully employed to help distribute flows subnationally both through in-migration and out-migration distributions and through calibrated distance-decay parameters.

to attract highly qualified foreigners to sectors facing labour shortages.
In the context of increasing internationalization of education, academic
mobility appears as a potential source of qualified workers from
host countries' perspective, either during their studies or through
subsequent recruitment. Study abroad can be part of a deliberate
immigration strategy from the perspective of students. The article
reviews the links between academic mobility and immigration and assesses
impact on immigration policies. Indeed, some OECD countries are allowing
foreign students to apply for resident status from within their territory

This article analyzes shifts in global migration patterns between 1960 and 2000 using indices that simultaneously capture changes in the spread, distance, and intensity of migration. While the results challenge the idea that there has been a global increase in volume, diversity, and geographical scope of migration, main migratory shifts have been directional. Migration has globalized from a destination country perspective but hardly from an origin country perspective, with migrants from an increasingly diverse array of non-European-origin countries concentrating in a shrinking pool of prime destination countries. The global migration map has thus become more skewed. Rather than refuting the globalization of migration hypothesis, this seems to reflect the asymmetric nature of globalization processes in general.},

They may be used in forecasting and they also facilitate indirect estimation made on the basis of incomplete data.

abstract = {Abstract.   Unlike the conventional calibration of a
gravity model in which nodal attractions are treated exogenously,
this study treats the attraction of a node as an endogenous composite
indicator of many contributing factors associated with the node and
estimates the nodal attraction based upon exogenous spatial interaction
(flow) and impedance data. An algebraic method is developed for the
general O-D matrix and applied to a hypothetical O-D flow case. A
theoretical discussion of utilizing regression to estimate the contributing
factors of nodal attractions is also presented.},

abstract = {More than 330 million people are still living in extreme poverty in Africa. Timely, accurate, and spatially fine-grained baseline data are essential to determining policy in favor of reducing poverty. The potential of "Big Data" to estimate socioeconomic factors in Africa has been proven. However, most current studies are limited to using a single data source. We propose a computational framework to accurately predict the Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) at a finest spatial granularity and coverage of 552 communes in Senegal using environmental data (related to food security, economic activity, and accessibility to facilities) and call data records (capturing individualistic, spatial, and temporal aspects of people). Our framework is based on Gaussian Process regression, a Bayesian learning technique, providing uncertainty associated with predictions. We perform model selection using elastic net regularization to prevent overfitting. Our results empirically prove the superior accuracy when using disparate data (Pearson correlation of 0.91). Our approach is used to accurately predict important dimensions of poverty: health, education, and standard of living (Pearson correlation of 0.84-0.86). All predictions are validated using deprivations calculated from census. Our approach can be used to generate poverty maps frequently, and its diagnostic nature is, likely, to assist policy makers in designing better interventions for poverty eradication.},

abstract = {We examine the effect of climate variability on human migration in South America. Our analyses draw on over 21 million observations of adults aged 15???40 from 25 censuses conducted in eight South American countries. Addressing limitations associated with methodological diversity among prior studies, we apply a common analytic approach and uniform definitions of migration and climate across all countries. We estimate the effects of climate variability on migration overall and also investigate heterogeneity across sex, age, and socioeconomic groups, across countries, and across historical climate conditions. We also disaggregate migration by the rural/urban status of destination. We find that exposure to monthly temperature shocks has the most consistent effects on migration relative to monthly rainfall shocks and gradual changes in climate over multi-year periods. We also find evidence of heterogeneity across demographic groups and countries. Analyses that disaggregate migration by the rural/urban status of destination suggest that much of the climate-related migration is directed toward urban areas. Overall, our results underscore the complexity of environment-migration linkages and challenge simplistic narratives that envision a linear and monolithic migratory response to changing climates.},

Four study areas are compared: Tuscany in Italy, Malta, the Costa del Sol of Spain, and the Algarve region of Portugal. The analysis focuses on the expressed reasons for moving to and residing in the areas, the reported advantages and disadvantages, and the respondents' predictions of whether they would stay or leave in response to adverse and beneficial events. Overall the subjects give very positive reports, but there are considerable differences among the four areas. The associations of individual variation in well-being with both a person's 'temporal commitment' to the area and to facets of their social integration are analysed. The onset of severe incapacity, sufficient to prevent the continued running of a home, is the event most likely to cause people to leave their adopted areas of residence.},

@article{Azose2018a,
abstract = {Despite the importance of international migration, estimates of between-country migration flows are still imprecise. Reliable record keeping of migration events is typically available only in the developed world, and the best existing methods to produce global migration flow estimates are burdened by strong assumptions. We produce estimates of migration flows between all pairs of countries at 5-year intervals, revealing patterns obscured by previous estimation methods. In particular, our estimates reveal large bidirectional movements in all global regions, with roughly one-quarter of migration events consisting of returns to an individual's country of birth. We propose a method for estimating migration flows between all pairs of countries that allows for decomposition of migration into emigration, return, and transit components. Current state-of-the-art estimates of bilateral migration flows rely on the assumption that the number of global migrants is as small as possible. We relax this assumption, producing complete estimates of all between-country migration flows with genuine estimates of total global migration. We find that the total number of individuals migrating internationally has oscillated between 1.13 and 1.29{\%} of the global population per 5-year period since 1990. Return migration and transit migration are big parts of total migration; roughly one of four migration events is a return to an individual's country of birth. In the most recent time period, we estimate particularly large return migration flows from the United States to Central and South America and from the Persian Gulf to south Asia.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

In recent years international migrationhas grown in volume, and is now an important factor of social transformation in all regions of the world. States classify migrants into certain categories, and seek to encourage certain types of mobility while restricting others. However,control measures are often ineffective if they are not based on understanding of the economic, social and cultural dynamics of migration. The article reviews causes and patterns of migration, and discusses some key issues: migration anddevelopment, international cooperation, settle-ment and ethnic diversity, and migration as a challenge to the nation-state. It is argued that most national governments have taken a short-term and reactive approach to migration. Effortsat international regulation are also relatively under-developed. There is a need for long-term cooperative strategies to achieve agreed goals such as: ensuring orderly migration and preventing exploitation by agents and recruiters;safeguarding the human rights of migrants; making migration an instrument of sustainable development; avoiding conflicts with populations of migrant-receiving areas, and maximising positive aspects of social and culturalchange.},

abstract = {We describe a Bayesian projection model to produce country-specific projections of the total fertility rate (TFR) for all countries. The model decomposes the evolution of TFR into three phases: pre-transition high fertility, the fertility transition, and post-transition low fertility. The model for the fertility decline builds on the United Nations Population Division's current deterministic projection methodology, which assumes that fertility will eventually fall below replacement level. It models the decline in TFR as the sum of two logistic functions that depend on the current TFR level, and a random term. A Bayesian hierarchical model is used to project future TFR based on both the country's TFR history and the pattern of all countries. It is estimated from United Nations estimates of past TFR in all countries using a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. The post-transition low fertility phase is modeled using an autoregressive model, in which long-term TFR projections converge toward and oscillate around replacement level. The method is evaluated using out-of-sample projections for the period since 1980 and the period since 1995, and is found to be well calibrated.},

Although migration brokers (”snakeheads”) play an important role in maintaining migratory flows already underway, they should not be seen as the root cause of migration from Fujian. In this article, we report on recently conducted fieldwork in two villages in central Fujian characterized by large-scale emigration to Europe. Emigration from this part of China is strongly embedded in local political, sociocultural and economic institutions and histories. Migration brokers are certainly a part, but not more than that, of these local institutions. We conclude that the local embeddedness of migration renders population mobility from each area in China highly specific, and broad generalizations on the causes, nature and direction of the totality of Chinese, or even Fujianese, migration are bound to misrepresent a highly complex reality.},

Probabilities are notoriously difficult to communicate effectively to lay audiences, and in this review we examine current practice for communicating uncertainties visually, using examples drawn from sport, weather, climate, health, economics, and politics. Despite the burgeoning interest in infographics, there is limited experimental evidence on how different types of visualizations are processed and understood, although the effectiveness of some graphics clearly depends on the relative numeracy of an audience. Fortunately, it is increasingly easy to present data in the form of interactive visualizations and in multiple types of representation that can be adjusted to user needs and capabilities.

abstract = {The advent of geographic online social networks such as Foursquare, where users voluntarily signal their current location, opens the door to powerful studies on human movement. In particular the fine granularity of the location data, with GPS accuracy down to 10 meters, and the worldwide scale of Foursquare adoption are unprecedented. In this paper we study urban mobility patterns of people in several metropolitan cities around the globe by analyzing a large set of Foursquare users. Surprisingly, while there are variations in human movement in different cities, our analysis shows that those are predominantly due to different distributions of places across different urban environments. Moreover, a universal law for human mobility is identified, which isolates as a key component the rank-distance, factoring in the number of places between origin and destination, rather than pure physical distance, as considered in some previous works. Building on our findings, we also show how a rank-based movement model accurately captures real human movements in different cities.},

This paper shows how to estimate the influence of policies upon bilateral migration flows to multiple destinations. We rely on a Poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood estimator to derive estimates that are consistent under more general distributional assumptions on the underlying RUM model than the ones commonly adopted in the literature. We derive bounds for the estimated direct and indirect effects of migration policies that reflect the uncertainty connected to the use of aggregate data, and we show that bilateral migration flows can be highly sensitive to the immigration policies set by other destination countries, an externality that we are able to quantify.},

abstract = {Most of the work on the early history of Chinese migration to eastern Europe, that is, the first half of the twentieth century, has been written by Russian scholars. Contemporary sources - accounts of Russian travellers and government documents - are overwhelmingly preoccupied with migration to the Russian Asian territories. But the interest in Chinese immigration since the 1990s has resulted in considerable attention being paid to the historical background as well, notably by Larin (1998, 2000) and Saveliev (2002). Chinese scholarship on Chinese. labour in Europe during World War I (e.g. S. Chen, 1986) only devotes little space to eastern Europe. Yet, Chinese migration to eastern Europe has a particular policy interest because in the past decade it has proven to be predictive of trends in Europe as a whole. A new flow of entrepreneurial migrants, who often had no connection to the historical, rural-based chains of migration that produced the earlier Chinese migrant populations of western Europe, found it possible and profitable to do business and settle on the European periphery during a brief period of liberal migration controls. Erratic crackdowns on illegal migration in the absence of thought-through migration regimes resulted in a volatile situation, periodically generating migration flows from one country in the region to another. These were facilitated by, and gave further rise to, networks of kinship and information spanning both eastern and western Europe. While this paper focuses on Hungary, it also attempts to review information on other eastern European countries (particularly Russia, Romania, Yugoslavia, and the Czech Republic) where it is available. In doing so, it intends to fill a gap in information on Chinese in eastern Europe until more substantial research is produced, as well as to highlight the common features of, and links between, Chinese migration into individual eastern European countries as well as into western Europe.},

Individual data on travel patterns have been difficult to obtain, particularly in low-income countries. Travel survey data provide detailed demographic information, but sample sizes are often small and travel histories are hard to validate. Mobile phone records can provide vast quantities of spatio-temporal travel data but vary in spatial resolution and explicitly do not include individual information in order to protect the privacy of subscribers. Here we compare and contrast both sources of data over the same time period in a rural area of Kenya. Although both data sets are able to quantify broad travel patterns and distinguish regional differences in travel, each provides different insights that can be combined to form a more detailed picture of travel in low-income settings to understand the spread of infectious diseases.},

abstract = {According to the International Organization for Migration1 and The World Bank2, without accounting for seasonal and temporary migrants, more than 1 billion people are currently living outside their places of origin, with about 740 million of them classified as internal migrants. Additionally, in 2014 around 67 million passengers travelled on international and domestic flights every week3 and hundreds of millions are estimated to commute daily by public transport and private vehicles4. Human mobility is expected to continue rising in volume and reach, producing increasing global connectivity that has a range of impacts, including rising numbers of invasive species, the spread of drug resistance, and disease pandemics. In this context, quantifying human mobility across multiple temporal and spatial scales, becomes crucial for quantifying its effects on society5–7, evaluating its relationship with the environment8,9, better understanding human-related processes such as urbanization and land use change10–13, and providing a strong evidence base to support both development14–16 and public health17–19 applications and policies. In public health, the role of human mobility in the spread of infectious diseases is exemplified by the presence of HIV/AIDS in areas outside where it first emerged at the beginning of the twentieth century20–22, the 2003 SARS epidemic23, the 2007 Chikungunya outbreaks in Italy and France24,25, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic26, the 2014 Ebola outbreak in Western Africa27, the resurgence of malaria cases in areas where the disease was once eliminated28, and the worldwide spread of drug resistant pathogens29. Consequently, it is clear that to provide better informed guidelines, both at the national and international level, the effects of human mobility and connectivity in driving disease dynamics need to be better understood and accounted for refs 30–33. Local malaria elimination and global malaria eradication are rising up the international agenda34–36. Evidence from the previous global malaria eradication program37, as well as from recent studies, control campaigns, and elimination efforts38–41 highlight the importance of accounting for human mobility in designing elimination plans. Infected people may unknowingly transport malaria parasites (potentially including antimalarial-resistant strains42) into new areas. Parasites can be imported either from other countries43 or from other areas within the same country44. Thus, because of the flow of imported cases from high- to low-transmission settings, the latter will face difficulties in achieving elimination and maintaining malaria-free status if it is achieved43. Nevertheless, despite the importance of these dynamics being long recognized45,46, attempts to translate human mobility model outputs into malaria policy are still rare.},

abstract = {We have shown previously that the AKT2 pathway is essential for cell survival and important in malignant transformation. In this study, we demonstrate elevated kinase levels of AKT2 and phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3K) in 32 of 80 primary breast carcinomas. The majority of the cases with the activation are estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) positive, which prompted us to examine whether AKT2 regulates ERalpha activity. We found that constitutively activated AKT2 or AKT2 activated by epidermal growth factor or insulin-like growth factor-1 promotes the transcriptional activity of ERalpha. This effect occurred in the absence or presence of estrogen. Activated AKT2 phosphorylates ERalpha in vitro and in vivo, but it does not phosphorylate a mutant ERalpha in which ser-167 was replaced by Ala. The PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin, abolishes both the phosphorylation and transcriptional activity of ERalpha induced by AKT2. However, AKT2-induced ERalpha activity was not inhibited by tamoxifen but was completely abolished by ICI 164,384, implicating that AKT2-activated ERalpha contributes to tamoxifen resistance. Moreover, we found that ERalpha binds to the p85alpha regulatory subunit of PI3K in the absence or presence of estradiol in epithelial cells and subsequently activates PI3K/AKT2, suggesting ERalpha regulation of PI3K/AKT2 through a nontranscriptional and ligand-independent mechanism. These data indicate that regulation between the ERalpha and PI3K/AKT2 pathway (ERalpha-PI3K/AKT2-ERalpha) may play an important role in pathogenesis of human breast cancer and could contribute to ligand-independent breast cancer cell growth.},

People can adapt to these problems by staying in place and doing nothing, staying in place and mitigating the problems, or leaving the affected areas. The choice between these options will depend on the extent of problems and mitigation capabilities. People living in lesser developed countries may be more likely to leave affected areas, which may cause conflict in receiving areas.

This study fills this gap in the literature by comprehensively investigating the possible factors associated with population projection accuracy in 2010 for the continental U.S. counties. The results indicate that the counties whose populations are more predictable tend to be desirable places—places with abundant employment opportunities, reliable public transportation infrastructure, easy access to work, and/or high land development potential; their neighbouring counties tend to have a well-educated population and a higher income level. Also, projection accuracy is highly spatially associated. The findings provide important insights for population projection users to understand the characteristics of counties and their neighbouring counties associated with their projection accuracy.},

In this paper, data known to be of a reliable standard is used to create an incomplete migration flow table of harmonized values. Cells for which no reliable reported flows exist are then estimated from a negative binomial regression model fitted using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. Finally, measures of precision for all missing cell estimates are derived using the Supplemented EM algorithm. Recent data on international migration between countries in Europe are used to illustrate the methodology. The results represent a complete table of comparable flows that can be used by regional policy makers and social scientists alike to better understand population behaviour and change.},

We blend mathematical demography and statistical time series methods to estimate stochastic models of fertility and mortality based on U.S. data back to 1900 and then use the theory of random-matrix products to forecast various demographic measures and their associated probability intervals to the year 2065. Our expected total population sizes agree quite closely with the Census medium projections, and our 95 percent probability intervals are close to the Census high and low scenarios. But Census intervals in 2065 for ages 65+ are nearly three times as broad as ours, and for 85+ are nearly twice as broad. In contrast, our intervals for the total dependency and youth dependency ratios are more than twice as broad as theirs, and our ratio for the elderly dependency ratio is 12 times as great as theirs. These items have major implications for policy, and these contrasting indications of uncertainty clearly show the limitations of the conventional scenario-based methods."},

We show that migration intent mined from internet search queries can forecast domestic migration and provide new insights beyond government data. We extract from a major search engine (Bing.com) 120 million raw queries with migration intent from 2014 to 2016, including origin and destination geographies, and the specific intent for migration such as whether the potential migration is housing or employment related. Using these queries, we map U.S. state level migration flows, validate them against government data, and demonstrate that adding search query-based metrics explains variance in migration prediction above robust baseline models. In addition, we show that the specific migration intent extracted from these queries unpack the differential demands of migrants with different demographic backgrounds and geographic interests. Examples include interactions between age, education, and income, and migration attributes such as buying versus renting housing and employment in technology versus manual labor job sectors. We discuss how local government, policy makers, and computational social scientists can benefit from this information.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Population movements following disasters can cause important increases in morbidity and mortality. Without knowledge of the locations of affected people, relief assistance is compromised. No rapid and accurate method exists to track population movements after disasters. We used position data of subscriber identity module (SIM) cards from the largest mobile phone company in Haiti (Digicel) to estimate the magnitude and trends of population movements following the Haiti 2010 earthquake and cholera outbreak.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS AND FINDINGS: Geographic positions of SIM cards were determined by the location of the mobile phone tower through which each SIM card connects when calling. We followed daily positions of SIM cards 42 days before the earthquake and 158 days after. To exclude inactivated SIM cards, we included only the 1.9 million SIM cards that made at least one call both pre-earthquake and during the last month of study. In Port-au-Prince there were 3.2 persons per included SIM card. We used this ratio to extrapolate from the number of moving SIM cards to the number of moving persons. Cholera outbreak analyses covered 8 days and tracked 138,560 SIM cards. An estimated 630,000 persons (197,484 Digicel SIM cards), present in Port-au-Prince on the day of the earthquake, had left 19 days post-earthquake. Estimated net outflow of people (outflow minus inflow) corresponded to 20{\%} of the Port-au-Prince pre-earthquake population. Geographic distribution of population movements from Port-au-Prince corresponded well with results from a large retrospective, population-based UN survey. To demonstrate feasibility of rapid estimates and to identify areas at potentially increased risk of outbreaks, we produced reports on SIM card movements from a cholera outbreak area at its immediate onset and within 12 hours of receiving data.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that estimates of population movements during disasters and outbreaks can be delivered rapidly and with potentially high validity in areas with high mobile phone use.},

abstract = {Georeferenced digital trace data offer unprecedented flexibility in migration estimation. Because of their high temporal granularity, many migration estimates can be generated from the same data set by changing the definition parameters. Yet despite the growing application of digital trace data to migration research, strategies for taking advantage of their temporal granularity remain largely underdeveloped. In this paper, we provide a general framework for converting digital trace data into estimates of migration transitions and for systematically analyzing their variation along a quasi-continuous time scale, analogous to a survival function. From migration theory, we develop two simple hypotheses regarding how we expect our estimated migration transition functions to behave. We then test our hypotheses on simulated data and empirical data from three platforms in two internal migration contexts: geotagged Tweets and Gowalla check-ins in the United States, and cell-phone call detail records in Senegal. Our results demonstrate the need for evaluating the internal consistency of migration estimates derived from digital trace data before using them in substantive research. At the same time, however, common patterns across our three empirical data sets point to an emergent research agenda using digital trace data to study the specific functional relationship between estimates of migration and time and how this relationship varies by geography and population characteristics.},

abstract = {The debate on migration and development has swung back and forth like a pendulum, from developmentalist optimism in the 1950s and 1960s, to neo-Marxist pessimism over the 1970s and 1980s, towards more optimistic views in the 1990s and 2000s. This paper argues how such discursive shifts in the migration and development debate should be primarily seen as part of more general paradigm shifts in social and development theory. However, the classical opposition between pessimistic and optimistic views is challenged by empirical evidence pointing to the heterogeneity of migration impacts. By integrating and amending insights from the new economics of labor migration, livelihood perspectives in development studies and transnational perspectives in migration studies – which share several though as yet unobserved conceptual parallels – this paper elaborates the contours of a conceptual framework that simultaneously integrates agency and structure perspectives and is therefore able to account for the heterogeneous nature of migration-development interactions. The resulting perspective reveals the naivety of recent views celebrating migration as self-help development ‘‘from below''. These views are largely ideologically driven and shift the attention away from structural constraints and the vital role of states in shaping favorable conditions for positive development impacts of migration to occur.},

abstract = {Numerous countries around the world are approaching malaria elimination. Until global eradication is achieved, countries that successfully eliminate the disease will contend with parasite reintroduction through international movement of infected people. Human-mediated parasite mobility is also important within countries near elimination, as it drives parasite flows that affect disease transmission on a subnational scale. Movement patterns exhibited in census-based migration data are compared with patterns exhibited in a mobile phone data set from Haiti to quantify how well migration data predict short-term movement patterns. Because short-term movement data were unavailable for Mesoamerica, a logistic regression model fit to migration data from three countries in Mesoamerica is used to predict flows of infected people between subnational administrative units throughout the region. Population flows predicted using census-based migration data correlated strongly with mobile phone-derived movements when used as a measure of relative connectivity. Relative population flows are therefore predicted using census data across Mesoamerica, informing the areas that are likely exporters and importers of infected people. Relative population flows are used to identify community structure, useful for coordinating interventions and elimination efforts to minimize importation risk. Finally, the ability of census microdata inform future intervention planning is discussed in a country-specific setting using Costa Rica as an example. These results show long-term migration data can effectively predict the relative flows of infected people to direct malaria elimination policy, a particularly relevant result because migration data are generally easier to obtain than short-term movement data such as mobile phone records. Further, predicted relative flows highlight policy-relevant population dynamics, such as major exporters across the region, and Nicaragua and Costa Rica's strong connection by movement of infected people, suggesting close coordination of their elimination efforts. Country-specific applications are discussed as well, such as predicting areas at relatively high risk of importation, which could inform surveillance and treatment strategies.},

abstract = {The focus of this paper is on cross-region R{\&}D collaboration funded by the fifth EU Framework Programme (FP5). The objective is to measure distance, institutional, language and technological barrier effects that may hamper collaborative activities between European regions. Particular emphasis is laid on measuring discrepancies between two types of collaborative R{\&}D activities, those generating output in terms of scientific publications and those that do not. The study area is composed of 255 NUTS-2 regions that cover the pre-2007 member states of the European Union (excluding Malta and Cyprus) as well as Norway and Switzerland. We employ a negative binomial spatial interaction model specification to address the research question, along with an eigenvector spatial filtering technique suggested by Fischer and Griffith (2008) to account for the presence of network autocorrelation in the origin-destination cooperation data. The study provides evidence that the role of geographical distance as collaborative deterrent is significantly lower if collaborations generate scientific output. Institutional barriers do not play a significant role for collaborations with scientific output. Language and technological barriers are smaller but the estimates indicate no significant discrepancies between the two types of collaborative R{\&}D activities that are in focus of this study.},

abstract = {International migration has become an established feature of contemporary social and economic life globally. It has both positive and negative features and opportunities for the countries and individuals involved. As a result, cross-border mobility has, in general, attracted a great deal of international policy attention in recent years. Two global reports were recently published (by the World Commission on the Social Dimension of Globalization in 2004 and the Commission on Human Security in 2003) that both placed migration issues firmly among their recommendations for a global policy agenda. Although not completely ignored, gender issues were not the focus of either report. By contrast, the recently launched (March 2005) report “Gender Equality: Striving for Justice in an Unequal World” by the UN Research Institute for Social Development (UNRISD) discusses a number of subject areas from a clear gender perspective, and one chapter is devoted to the issue of work migration. In addition, there are two UN reports focusing on women and migration: one by the Division for the Advancement of Women (2004); and the latest World Survey on the role of women in development by the UN devoted to the issue of ‘women and international migration' (2004).

abstract = {"A full multiregional projection model requires migration data that are simultaneously classified by age and gender and region of origin and region of destination. Except for a very small number of regions, these data requirements are so high that aggregation of the data (which is equivalent to simplification of the model) is called for. This paper investigates the extent to which the full internal migration matrix can be simplified without seriously affecting the performance of the resulting multiregional model. Using IPF (iterative proportional fitting) methods, a log-linear analysis of alternative model specifications is made, using data for Italy, the Netherlands and the UK....A reasonable balance between goodness-of-fit and parsimony is found for the model in which time interacts with the main effects only (i.e. with age/sex, with origin and with destination)."},

abstract = {This paper reports the results of an extensive project to model interregional migration within England and Wales. The project took place over a two-year period and was sponsored by the UK Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (formerly the Department of Transport, Local Government and the Regions). The results of the study are reported in three separate papers. In this paper we present an overview of the project and then describe in detail both the process of modelling out-migration rates from origins across England and Wales and the calibration results from this modelling stage. The results yield important information on the determinants of out-migration and population re-distribution within England and Wales. In paper 2 we describe the modelling of the destination choices of migrants and the calibration results from such models. In paper 3 we tie both the out-migration and the destination choice results together into a mapping and visualisation system (MIGMOD) which can be used to assess the impacts of various policies on population movements in England and Wales. The simple policy scenarios reported in this third paper are illustrative and indicative of the model's potential, rather than necessarily being a true reflection of the effects of policy changes. The three papers contribute substantially to the existing migration literature because they present the most exhaustive analysis of the determinants of both out-migration and destination choice that has ever been undertaken. The number of variables in both modelling processes is far larger than has ever been assembled before and the results therefore provide much greater insight into the role of various attributes in determining out-migration rates and in-migration rates than has previously been possible. The papers also provide an interesting lesson in a problem rarely encountered -- that of having too much data.},

Circos uses a circular ideogram layout to facilitate the display of relationships between pairs of positions by the use of ribbons, which encode the position, size, and orientation of related genomic elements. Circos is capable of displaying data as scatter, line, and histogram plots, heat maps, tiles, connectors, and text.

@article{Tatem2014a,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: As successful malaria control programmes re-orientate towards elimination, the identification of transmission foci, targeting of attack measures to high-risk areas and management of importation risk become high priorities. When resources are limited and transmission is varying seasonally, approaches that can rapidly prioritize areas for surveillance and control can be valuable, and the most appropriate attack measure for a particular location is likely to differ depending on whether it exports or imports malaria infections. METHODS/RESULTS: Here, using the example of Namibia, a method for targeting of interventions using surveillance data, satellite imagery, and mobile phone call records to support elimination planning is described. One year of aggregated movement patterns for over a million people across Namibia are analyzed, and linked with case-based risk maps built on satellite imagery. By combining case-data and movement, the way human population movements connect transmission risk areas is demonstrated. Communities that were strongly connected by relatively higher levels of movement were then identified, and net export and import of travellers and infection risks by region were quantified. These maps can aid the design of targeted interventions to maximally reduce the number of cases exported to other regions while employing appropriate interventions to manage risk in places that import them. CONCLUSIONS: The approaches presented can be rapidly updated and used to identify where active surveillance for both local and imported cases should be increased, which regions would benefit from coordinating efforts, and how spatially progressive elimination plans can be designed. With improvements in surveillance systems linked to improved diagnosis of malaria, detailed satellite imagery being readily available and mobile phone usage data continually being collected by network providers, the potential exists to make operational use of such valuable, complimentary and contemporary datasets on an ongoing basis in infectious disease control and elimination.},

Forecasting refugee movements is important, as accurate predictions can help save refugee lives by allowing governments and NGOs to conduct a better informed allocation of humanitarian resources. Here, we propose a generalized simulation development approach to predict the destinations of refugee movements in con ict regions. In this approach, we synthesize data from UNHCR, ACLED and Bing Maps to construct agent-based simulations of refugee movements. We apply our approach to develop, run and validate refugee movement simulations set in three major African con icts, estimating the distribution of incoming refugees across destination camps, given the expected total number of refugees in the con ict. Our simulations consistently predict more than 75{\%} of the refugee destinations correctly after the rst 12 days, and consistently outperform alternative naive forecasting techniques. Using our approach, we are also able to reproduce key trends in refugee arrival rates found in the UNHCR data.},

It introduces new analytical tools and methods, and shares application of innovative approaches to analyzing cross-sectional and longitudinal survey data and macro socioeconomic data to shed light on changing mechanisms of low fertility in the context of reproductive health. The volume introduces the demographic dividend into the study of fertility, analyzes possible impact of population ageing on the amount of resources allocated to child rearing, i.e. the so called "crowding-out effect" in social care and public spending between the elderly and children. The book also tests the Low Fertility Trap (LFT) hypothesis, a new important theory regarding fertility trends. The book focuses on East Asia which is numerically large but relatively under-researched with regard to issues covered in various chapters. The relevance of the volume, however, goes beyond countries in East Asia.

The adoption of new international labour standards on domestic work (Convention No. 189 and its accompanying Recommendation No. 201) by the ILO at its 100th International Labour Conference in June 2011 represents a key milestone on the path to the realization of decent work for domestic workers. This volume presents national statistics and new global and regional estimates on the number of domestic workers. It shows that domestic workers represent a significant share of the labour force worldwide and that domestic work is an important source of wage employment for women, especially in Latin America and Asia. It also examines the extent of inclusion or exclusion of domestic workers from key working conditions laws. In particular, it analyses how many domestic workers are covered by working time provisions, minimum wage legislation and maternity protection. The results demonstrate that under current national laws, substantial gaps in protection still remain. The volume concludes with a summary of the main findings and a reflection on the relevance of the newly adopted international standards to extend legal protection to domestic workers." From author},

abstract = {The aim of the present study was to determine effects of lactation on basal LH and IGF-I concentrations and on the LH response to a GnRH-analogue at different stages of the oestrous cycle in mares. A total of 17 cyclic Haflinger mares were included in the study. Experiments were performed on lactating mares in first postpartum oestrus, the subsequent early luteal phase, and second postpartum oestrus. Non-lactating mares were used in oestrus and early luteal phase. Blood samples were taken for 1 h at 15 min intervals. Mares were then injected with the GnRH-analogue buserelin (GnRHa; 5 mu g i.v.) and blood samples were drawn every 15 min for further 2 h. LH in all samples and basal IGF-1-concentrations were determined by RIA. In lactating mares, basal LH concentrations during the early luteal phase tended to be lower (p=0.07) and the LH response to GnRHa, calculated as area under the curve, was significantly less pronounced compared to non-lactating mares (p {\textless} 0.01). As well in lactating mares, the basal LH concentration between first early luteal phase and second oestrus differed significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) and the net response to GnRHa was significantly lower between first oestrus as well as second oestrus and first early luteal phase (p {\textless} 0.05) but not between first and second oestrous postpartum. Within the group of non-lactating mares, the LH response to GnRHa was as well significantly lower during oestrus than during early luteal phase (p {\textless} 0.01). IGF-I concentrations differed neither between groups nor stages of the cycle within groups. In conclusion, basal and GnRHa-stimulated LH release in lactating mares is lower than in non-lactating mares. This difference, however, occurs only in the early luteal phase. In lactating mares, concentrations of LH appear adequate to allow ovulation to occur. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Long-term economic scenarios (up to 2100) are needed as a basis to explore possible different futures for major environmental challenges, including climate change. Given the high level of uncertainty involved, such scenarios would need to span a wide range of possible growth trajectories. The recently developed storylines of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) provide a basis for making such projections. This paper describes a consistent methodology to derive (per capita) GDP trend pathways on a country basis. The methodology is based on a convergence process and places emphasis on the key drivers of economic growth in the long run: population, total factor productivity, physical capital, employment and human capital, and energy and fossil fuel resources (specifically oil and gas). The paper uses this methodology to derive country-level economic growth projections for 184 countries. The paper also investigates the influence of short-term growth rate estimates on the long-term income levels in various countries. It does so by comparing long-term projections based on short-term forecasts from 2011 with the projections based on forecasts from 2013. This highlights the effects of the recent economic crisis and uncertainty in short term developments on longer term growth trends. The projections are subject to large uncertainties, particularly for the later decades, and disregard a wide range of country-specific drivers of economic growth that are outside the narrow economic framework, such as external shocks, governance barriers and feedbacks from environmental damage. Hence, they should be interpreted with sufficient care and not be treated as predictions.},

abstract = {Migration studies have a long history within regional science. This paper reviews the current status of migration research within regional science and asks whether migration continues to maintain the presence and import in regional science that appeared in earlier, similar analyses such as Anselin and Rey (Int Reg Sci Rev 23(4):323{\^{a}}€“344, 2000 ) and Plane and Bitter (Pap Reg Sci J RSAI 76:133{\^{a}}€“153, 1997 ). The paper looks at the relative strength of migration studies within regional science and the challenges (and concomitant) opportunities that are available. It begins by replicating a portion of a 1997 study by Plane and Bitter which evaluated the prevalence of migration research within the regional science literature. Based on findings that the proportion of both migration and population-themed papers have decreased, the paper then considers the challenges facing researchers, including data and training challenges, along with the need to ensure that migration research remains relevant, before offering concluding remarks.},

abstract = {There is relatively little work on the investigation of large-scale human data in terms of multimodality for human activity discovery. In this paper, we suggest that human interaction data, or human proximity, obtained by mobile phone Bluetooth sensor data, can be integrated with human location data, obtained by mobile cell tower connections, to mine meaningful details about human activities from large and noisy datasets. We propose a model, called bag of multimodal behavior, that integrates the modeling of variations of location over multiple time-scales, and the modeling of interaction types from proximity. Our representation is simple yet robust to characterize real-life human behavior sensed from mobile phones, which are devices capable of capturing large-scale data known to be noisy and incomplete. We use an unsupervised approach, based on probabilistic topic models, to discover latent human activities in terms of the joint interaction and location behaviors of 97 individuals over the course of approximately a 10-month period using data from MIT's Reality Mining project. Some of the human activities discovered with our multimodal data representation include going out from 7 pmmidnight alone and working from 11 am5 pm with 35 other people, further finding that this activity dominantly occurs on specific days of the week. Our methodology also finds dominant work patterns occurring on other days of the week. We further demonstrate the feasibility of the topic modeling framework for human routine discovery by predicting missing multimodal phone data at specific times of the day. {\textcopyright} 2010 IEEE.},

In this work, we study gender trends in employment across various dimensions in the United States. This is done by analyzing anonymous, aggregate statistics that were extracted from LinkedIn's advertising platform. The data contain the number of male and female LinkedIn users with respect to (i) location, (ii) age, (iii) industry and (iv) certain skills. We studied which of these categories correlate the most with high relative male or female presence on LinkedIn. In addition to examining the summary statistics of the LinkedIn data, we model the gender balance as a function of the different employee features using linear regression. Our results suggest that the gender gap varies across all feature types, but the differences are most profound among industries and skills. A high correlation between gender ratios of people in our LinkedIn data set and data provided by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics serves as external validation for our results.},

Focusing on fertility as one key to accurate projections - the committee examines the transition from high, constant fertility to low fertility levels and discusses whether developing countries will eventually attain the very low levels of births now observed in the industrialized world. Other keys to accurate projections, predictions of lengthening life span, and the impact of international migration on specific countries, are also explored in detail.How good are our methods of population forecasting? How can we cope with the inevitable uncertainty? What population trends can we anticipate?

abstract = {Night-time satellite imagery provided by the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program's Operational Linescan System (DMSP OLS) is evaluated as a means of estimating the population of all the cities of the world based on their areal extent in the image. A global night-time image product was registered to a dataset of 2000 known city locations with known populations. A relationship between areal extent and city population discovered by Tobler and Nordbeck is identified on a nation by nation basis to estimate the population of the 22 920 urban clusters that exist in the night-time satellite image. The relationship between city population and city areal extent was derived from 1597 city point locations with known population that landed in a 'lit' area of the image. Due to conurbation, these 1597 cities resulted in only 1383 points of analysis for performing regression. When several cities fell into one 'lit' area their populations were summed. The results of this analysis allow for an estimate of the urban population of every nation of the world. By using the known percent of population in urban areas for every nation a total national population was also estimated. The sum of these estimates is a total estimate of the global human population, which in this case was 6.3 billion. This is fairly close to the generally accepted contemporaneous (1997) estimate of the global population which stood at approximately 5.9 billion.},

abstract = {Migration plays an increasing role in China's economy since mobility rose and economic restructuring has proceeded during the last three decades. Given the background of most studies focusing on migration in a particular period, there is a critical need to analyze the spatial-temporal patterns of migration. Using bicomponent trend mapping technique and interprovincial migration data during the periods 1985-1990, 1990-1995, 1995-2000, 2000-2005, and 2005-2010 we analyze net-, in-, out-migration intensity, and their changes over time in this study. Strong spatial variations in migration intensity were found in China's interprovincial migration, and substantial increase in migration intensity was also detected in eastern China during 1985-2010. Eight key destinations are mostly located within the three rapidly growing economic zones of eastern China (Pearl River Delta, Yangtze River Delta and Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Metropolitan Region), and they are classified into three type: mature, emerging, and fluctuant origins, while most key origins are relatively undeveloped central and western provinces, which are exactly in accordance with China's economic development patterns. The results of bicomponent trend mapping indicate that, in a sense, the migration in the south was more active than the north over the last three decades. The result shows the new changing features of spatial-temporal patterns of China's interprovincial migration that Fan and Chen did not find out in their research. A series of social-economic changes including rural transformation, balanced regional development, and labor market changes should be paid more attention to explore China's future interprovincial migration.},

@article{Hadiji2013,
abstract = {Many collective human activities have been shown to exhibit universal patterns. However, the possibility of universal patterns across timing events of researcher migration has barely been explored at global scale. Here, we show that timing events of migration within different countries exhibit remarkable similarities. Specifically, we look at the distribution governing the data of researcher migration inferred from the web. Compiling the data in itself represents a significant advance in the field of quantitative analysis of migration patterns. Official and commercial records are often access restricted, incompatible between countries, and especially not registered across researchers. Instead, we introduce GeoDBLP where we propagate geographical seed locations retrieved from the web across the DBLP database of 1,080,958 authors and 1,894,758 papers. But perhaps more important is that we are able to find statistical patterns and create models that explain the migration of researchers. For instance, we show that the science job market can be treated as a Poisson process with individual propensities to migrate following a log-normal distribution over the researcher's career stage. That is, although jobs enter the market constantly, researchers are generally not "memoryless" but have to care greatly about their next move. The propensity to make k{\textgreater}1 migrations, however, follows a gamma distribution suggesting that migration at later career stages is "memoryless". This aligns well but actually goes beyond scientometric models typically postulated based on small case studies. On a very large, transnational scale, we establish the first general regularities that should have major implications on strategies for education and research worldwide.},

abstract = {Projections of countries{\^{a}} future populations, broken down by age and sex, are widely used for planning and research. They are mostly done deterministically, but there is a widespread need for probabilistic projections. We propose a Bayesian method for probabilistic population projections for all countries. The total fertility rate and female and male life expectancies at birth are projected probabilistically using Bayesian hierarchical models estimated via Markov chain Monte Carlo using United Nations population data for all countries. These are then converted to age-specific rates and combined with a cohort component projection model. This yields probabilistic projections of any population quantity of interest. The method is illustrated for five countries of different demographic stages, continents and sizes. The method is validated by an out of sample experiment in which data from 1950{\^{a}} 1990 are used for estimation, and applied to predict 1990{\^{a}} 2010. The method appears reasonably accurate and well calibrated for this period. The results suggest that the current United Nations high and low variants greatly underestimate uncertainty about the number of oldest old from about 2050 and that they underestimate uncertainty for high fertility countries and overstate uncertainty for countries that have completed the demographic transition and whose fertility has started to recover towards replacement level, mostly in Europe. The results also indicate that the potential support ratio (persons aged 20{\^{a}} 64 per person aged 65+) will almost certainly decline dramatically in most countries over the coming decades.},

abstract = {The estimation of commuting flows at different spatial scales is a fundamental problem for different areas of study. Many current methods rely on parameters requiring calibration from empirical trip volumes. Their values are often not generalizable to cases without calibration data. To solve this problem we develop a statistical expression to calculate commuting trips with a quantitative functional form to estimate the model parameter when empirical trip data is not available. We calculate commuting trip volumes at scales from within a city to an entire country, introducing a scaling parameter $\alpha$ to the recently proposed parameter free radiation model. The model requires only widely available population and facility density distributions. The parameter can be interpreted as the influence of the region scale and the degree of heterogeneity in the facility distribution. We explore in detail the scaling limitations of this problem, namely under which conditions the proposed model can be applied without trip data for calibration. On the other hand, when empirical trip data is available, we show that the proposed model's estimation accuracy is as good as other existing models. We validated the model in different regions in the U.S., then successfully applied it in three different countries.},

(Rimas NorvaiAa, Mathematical Reviews, Issue 2007 f) Product Description This is a graduate level textbook on measure theory and probability theory. The book can be used as a text for a two semester sequence of courses in measure theory and probability theory, with an option to include supplemental material on stochastic processes and special topics. It is intended primarily for first year Ph.D. students in mathematics and statistics although mathematically advanced students from engineering and economics would also find the book useful. Prerequisites are kept to the minimal level of an understanding of basic real analysis concepts such as limits, continuity, differentiability, Riemann integration, and convergence of sequences and series. A review of this material is included in the appendix. The book starts with an informal introduction that provides some heuristics into the abstract concepts of measure and integration theory, which are then rigorously developed. The first part of the book can be used for a standard real analysis course for both mathematics and statistics Ph.D. students as it provides full coverage of topics such as the construction of Lebesgue-Stieltjes measures on real line and Euclidean spaces, the basic convergence theorems, L p spaces, signed measures, Radon-Nikodym theorem, Lebesgue's decomposition theorem and the fundamental theorem of Lebesgue integration on R, product spaces and product measures, and Fubini-Tonelli theorems. It also provides an elementary introduction to Banach and Hilbert spaces, convolutions, Fourier series and Fourier and Plancherel transforms. Thus part I would be particularly useful for students in a typical Statistics Ph.D. program if a separate course on real analysis is not a standard requirement. Part II (chapters 6-13) provides full coverage of standard graduate level probability theory. It starts with Kolmogorov's probability model and Kolmogorov's existence theorem. It then treats thoroughly the laws of large numbers including renewal theory and ergodic theorems with applications and then weak convergence of probability distributions, characteristic functions, the Levy-Cramer continuity theorem and the central limit theorem as well as stable laws. It ends with conditional expectations and conditional probability, and an introduction to the theory of discrete time martingales. Part III (chapters 14-18) provides a modest coverage of discrete time Markov chains with countable and general state spaces, MCMC, continuous time discrete space jump Markov processes, Brownian motion, mixing sequences, bootstrap methods, and branching processes. It could be used for a topics/seminar course or as an introduction to stochastic processes.

The article conceptualizes the notion of migration policy change and presents the coding system used to operationalize policy content, changes in policy restrictiveness, as well as the magnitude of policy changes. The paper also discusses the potential of DEMIG POLICY to improve our understanding of the nature, evolution, and effectiveness of migration policies. Besides significantly extending the geographical and historical coverage of existing migration policy databases, DEMIG POLICY also tracks emigration policies in order to overcome the common 'receiving country bias' in migration research. By offering key insights into the main features of the largest migration policy database completed to date, this paper hopes to provide useful guidelines to improve future efforts to measure migration policies. Such improvement is crucial given the heated debates on migration policy effectiveness on one hand and the still limited empirical evidence on this issue on the other.},

@unpublished{Abel2016b,
abstract = {Here we show the extent to which the expected world population growth could be lowered by successfully implementing the recently agreed-upon Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs include specific quantitative targets on mortality, reproductive health, and education for all girls by 2030, measures that will directly and indirectly affect future demographic trends. Based on a multidimensional model of population dynamics that stratifies national populations by age, sex, and level of education with educational fertility and mortality differentials, we translate these goals into SDG population scenarios, resulting in population sizes between 8.2 and 8.7 billion in 2100. Because these results lie outside the 95{\%} prediction range given by the 2015 United Nations probabilistic population projections, we com-plement the study with sensitivity analyses of these projections that suggest that those prediction intervals are too narrow because of un-certainty in baseline data, conservative assumptions on correlations, and the possibility of new policies influencing these trends. Although the analysis presented here rests on several assumptions about the implementation of the SDGs and the persistence of educational, fer-tility, and mortality differentials, it quantitatively illustrates the view that demography is not destiny and that policies can make a decisive difference. In particular, advances in female education and reproduc-tive health can contribute greatly to reducing world population growth. world population | scenarios | Sustainable Development Goals | female education | reproductive health T oday, the future of world population growth looks more uncertain than it did a decade ago because of a controversial recent stalling of fertility decline in a number of African coun-tries and a controversy over how low below replacement level fertility will fall, particularly in China (1). Probabilistic population projections try to quantify these uncertainties based on statistical extrapolation, expert judgement, or a blend of both (2, 3). Al-though such projections published in 2008 (4) gave a 95{\%} pre-diction interval ranging from 5.2 to 12.7 billion for the global population in the year 2100, probabilistic projections published by the United Nations (UN) Population Division in 2015 based on a different approach give a much narrower 95{\%} interval ranging from 9.5 to 13 billion in 2100 (3). Another recent set of world population projections defined alternative global population sce-narios in the context of the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and related integrated assessment models. In the medium scenario these Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) show a peaking of world population around 2070 at 9.4 billion, followed by a decline to 9 billion by the end of the century with high and low scenarios reaching 12.8 and 7.1 billion, respectively (5, 6). As discussed below, these differences in world population projections result from different approaches taken in terms of disaggregating national populations according to age, sex, and education structures and in combining statistical extrapolation with expert knowledge in specifying assumptions for the future. In September 2015 the leaders of the world under the um-brella of the United Nations in New York subscribed to an ambitious set of global development goals, the Sustainable De-velopment Goals (SDGs). If actually pursued, several of these targets, particularly in the fields of reproductive health and female education, will have strong direct and indirect effects on future population trends, mostly in the direction of lower population growth. In this paper we endeavor to translate the most relevant of these goals into SDG population scenarios and thus quantify the likely effects of meeting these development goals on national population trajectories. The results show that meeting these goals would result in the world population peaking around 2060 and reaching 8.2–8.7 billion by 2100, depending on the specific SDG scenario (Fig. 1). This analysis quantitatively demonstrates that demography is not destiny and that policies, particularly in the field of female education and reproductive health, can contribute greatly to reducing world population growth. The different variants of the SDG scenario specified here, al-though consistent with the SPP scenarios, all lie substantially below the lower bound of the 95{\%} band given by the most recent prob-abilistic UN projections (Fig. 1). This difference evidently poses serious questions to the reader. Therefore, after describing the definition and calibration of the demographic SDG scenarios, this paper has a second section in which we perform sensitivity analyses of the UN population projections, using the UN's software; our analyses suggest that the prediction range given by the UN un-derestimates the full uncertainty of possible future world pop-ulation growth. We study the sensitivity with respect to possible baseline errors and correlation and show how explicit incorporation of heterogeneity in level of education changes the picture. Our main point, however, is that the UN model rests on the strong assumption of structural continuity of past trends extrapolated over},

abstract = {The effectiveness of migration policies has been widely contested. However, because of methodological and conceptual limitations, evidence has remained inconclusive. Moreover, prior studies focus on the effects of policies on inflows and fail to assess the simultaneous effect of policies on outflows. This is essential from a theoretical point of view as immigration restrictions may reduce both inflows and outflows and, hence, overall circulation. This renders the effect of immigration restrictions on net migration theoretically ambiguous. To fill this gap, and using unique migration and visa data from the Determinants of International Migration (DEMIG) project, this paper assesses the short- and long-term effects of travel visa policy regimes on bilateral immigration and emigration dynamics. The results suggest that travel visa policies significantly decrease inflows, but this effect is undermined by decreasing outflows of the same migrant groups. This confirms that migration restrictions decrease circulation and tend to encourage long-term settlement, and thereby sharply reduce the responsiveness of migration to economic fluctuations in destination and origin societies. We also identify asymmetric policy effects with migration flows declining only very gradually after a visa introduction but increasing almost immediately after visa removal.},

abstract = {International migration is of major relevance for the development of countries of origin, transit and destination. While the proportion of the world population who live outside their countries of birth has stayed relatively stable over time, the absolute number of international migrants reached 244 million in 2015. International migration has been recognized as a driver of development in both countries of origin and destination, and in turn, patterns of global development both strongly impact, and are impacted by, migration. Data sources to inform the issue of international migration include decennial population and housing censuses, population registers, civil registration and other administrative data, residence permits and various household surveys. While providing a valuable source of data on international migration, censuses are sometimes conducted infrequently or the data from census are not fully released, or remain under-analyzed. This paper reports on the availability of migration data from all national population censuses by countries that participated in the 2010 census round, and highlights the potential of these data for the generation of migration profiles and analysis on the character of international migration especially within the context of monitoring and reporting the sustainable development goals.},

abstract = {This paper presents accounts and models which can be used for spatial demographic analysis. It is shown that in any time period there are sixteen different kinds of demographic flows for a two region system. These flows can be represented in an accounting table. Some of the minor flows, involving double or triple demographic events such as a birth followed by a migration, cannot be measured directly from data, and an iterative scheme is offered for the calculation of these flows. In this way a complete set of accounts can be built up from existing data. Two principles of model building using this set of accounts are then discussed. The first uses a simple definition of demographic rates, while the second uses a definition of rates which employs a concept of ‘at-risk' populations. Procedures are given for calculating these populations. The account building principles are illustrated with a worked example for a three region system: the West Riding of Yorkshire, the rest of England and Wales, and the rest of the world. The results presented in this paper are for aggregate populations. In a subsequent paper equivalent results will be presented for age/sex disaggregated populations.},

abstract = {Drawing on the new DEMIG POLICY database that comprises over 6,500 migration policy changes in 45 countries, this paper analyses the nature and evolution of migration policies over the 20th and early 21st centuries. The findings challenge the common assumption that migration policies have become increasingly restrictive over the past decades, and instead demonstrate that since 1945 migration policies have been consistently dominated by less restrictive changes. This trend is robust across a large number of countries, but differs across policy types and migrant categories. While entry and integration policies have generally become less restrictive, border control and, since the 1990s, exit policies have become more restrictive. Instead of a growing restrictiveness, the essence of post-WWII migration policies has been an increasing sophistication through the development of specific policy instruments targeting particular immigrant groups. While policies towards migrant categories such as irregular migrants and, more recently, family members have often become more restrictive, a larger number of – generally less visible – policies targeting high and low-skilled workers, students and migrants from specific origins have become less restrictive. Migration policies should therefore be understood as a tool of migrant selection rather than as an instrument affecting numbers.

has declined exponentially at a roughly constant rate. This trend
places a constraint on any theory of society-driven mortality decline,
and provides a basis for stochastic mortality forecasting. We find
that median forecasts of life expectancy are substantially larger

we forecast values of the dependency ratio (that is, the ratio of
people over 65 to working people) in 2050 that are between 6{\%} (UK)

abstract = {Measuring and forecasting migration patterns has important implications for understanding broader population trends, for designing policy effectively and for allocating resources. However, data on migration and mobility are often lacking, and those that do exist are not available in a timely manner. Social media data offer new opportunities to provide more up-to-date demographic estimates and to complement more traditional data sources. Facebook's Advertising Platform, for example, is a potentially rich data source of demographic information that is regularly updated. However, Facebook's users are not representative of the underlying population. This paper proposes a statistical framework to combine social media data with traditional survey data to produce timely ‘nowcasts' of migrant stocks by state in the United States. The model incorporates bias adjustment of Facebook data, and a pooled principal component time series approach, to account for correlations across age, time and space. We use the model to estimate and project migrants from Mexico, India and Germany, three migrant groups with varying levels and trends of migration in the US. By comparing short-term projections with data from the American Community Survey, we show that the model predictions outperform alternatives that rely solely on either social media or survey data.},

abstract = {Quantitative Geography is a lucid and comprehensive overview of the
use of quantitative methods in spatial data analysis. It focuses
on the philosophy informing spatial analysis and demonstrates the
significant differences between modern quantitative methods and the
methods associated with Geography's 'Quantitative Revolution' in
the sixties. The text integrates a discussion of the application
of quantitative methods with practical examples, and explains the
philosophy of the new quantitative methodologies. Comprising a discussion
of specific techniques, Quantitative Geography critically examines
the profound difference in the use of those techniques since the
Quantitative Revolution. Key issues include: spatial data; geographical
information systems; visualization; local analysis; point pattern
analysis; spatial regression; and statistical inference. Concluding
with a review of models used in spatial theory, the text goes on
to discuss the current challenges to spatial data analysis. Written
to be accessible, to communicate the diversity and excitement of
recent thinking, Quantitative Geography will be required reading
for students and researchers in any discipline where quantitative
methods are used to analyze spatial data.},

abstract = {The expanding global air network provides rapid and wide-reaching connections accelerating both domestic and international travel. To understand human movement patterns on the network and their socioeconomic, environmental and epidemiological implications, information on passenger flow is required. However, comprehensive data on global passenger flow remain difficult and expensive to obtain, prompting researchers to rely on scheduled flight seat capacity data or simple models of flow. This study describes the construction of an open-access modeled passenger flow matrix for all airports with a host city-population of more than 100,000 and within two transfers of air travel from various publicly available air travel datasets. Data on network characteristics, city population, and local area GDP amongst others are utilized as covariates in a spatial interaction framework to predict the air transportation flows between airports. Training datasets based on information from various transportation organizations in the United States, Canada and the European Union were assembled. A log-linear model controlling the random effects on origin, destination and the airport hierarchy was then built to predict passenger flows on the network, and compared to the results produced using previously published models. Validation analyses showed that the model presented here produced improved predictive power and accuracy compared to previously published models, yielding the highest successful prediction rate at the global scale. Based on this model, passenger flows between 1,491 airports on 644,406 unique routes were estimated in the prediction dataset. The airport node characteristics and estimated passenger flows are freely available as part of the Vector-Borne Disease Airline Importation Risk (VBD-Air) project at: www.vbd-air.com/data.},

In this book different macro and micro approaches for estimating and projecting populations are reviewed, trends in the components of change in the UK (births, deaths and migration) are presented, international comparisons of internal migration are drawn, impacts of population ageing are considered and a new perspective on understanding urban evolution is offered. All these themes are interconnected in one way or another and collectively represent a compendium of the research interests of Professor Rees.

Despite its widespread use, it relies on adjustable parameters that vary from region to region and suffers from known analytic inconsistencies. Here we introduce a stochastic process capturing local mobility decisions that helps us analytically derive commuting and mobility fluxes that require as input only information on the population distribution. The resulting radiation model predicts mobility patterns in good agreement with mobility and transport patterns observed in a wide range of phenomena, from long-term migration patterns to communication volume between different regions. Given its parameter-free nature, the model can be applied in areas where we lack previous mobility measurements, significantly improving the predictive accuracy of most of the phenomena affected by mobility and transport processes.},

The network has connected travelers to cost-free lodging for over 5 years with over 1 million current members. Now it provides a large user database where each user is tagged with a location. This is useful for spatial data mining and knowledge discovery as recommendations about locations are left in user reviews of one another. These are drawn upon to find interesting locations and discover new places, people and activities. Techniques from the field of time geography are used with LBSN information about individual member location to show how spatiotemporal constraints combine the virtual and physical worlds.

Experiments 2 and 2a used a one-shot single-trial between-subjects design and obtained similar results. Experiment 3 investigated the way in which the between-trials context influenced forecasting. The results showed that forecasts are affected by the characteristics of previous series, as well as those of the series from which forecasts are to be made.

Based on four reference regions, the NTL imagery of China was fully intercalibrated during the period 1992–2012.

The results showed that, over the whole country, the pixel numbers of urban areas increased by 173{\%} from 1992 to 2012. During the 2000s, urban areas expanded much more quickly than during the 1990s. Urban growth varied greatly across the four regions, which could be pictured using the flying-geese paradigm. In the 1990s, East China experienced the most rapid rate of growth, while a decade later Middle China had the highest growth rate. NTL imagery can also be used to describe changes in rural human activities if the imagery is corrected using completely dark rural pixels. In China, because of the massive rural-urban migration, some marginal regions experienced a decrease in nighttime light intensity (NTLI) and rural areas went through a period of transition.},

abstract = {In the social and other sciences many data are collected with a known but complex underlying structure. Over the past two decades there has been an increase in the   use of multilevel modelling techniques that account for nested data structures. Often however the underlying data structures are more complex and cannot be fitted  into a nested structure. First, there are cross-classified models where the classifications in the data are not nested. Secondly, we consider multiple   membership models where an observation does not belong simply to one member of a classification. These two extensions when combined allow us to fit models to a large   array of underlying structures. Existing frequentist modelling approaches to fitting such data have some important computational limitations. In this paper we consider  ways of overcoming such limitations using Bayesian methods, since Bayesian model fitting is easily accomplished using Monte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) techniques. In examples where we have been able to make direct comparisons, Bayesian methods in conjunction with suitable  diffuse' prior distributions lead to similar inferences to existing frequentist techniques. In this paper we illustrate our techniques with examples in the fields of education, veterinary epidemiology, demography, and public health illustrating the diversity of models that fit into our framework.},

abstract = {Stochastic methods of multi-state population modeling are less developed than methods for single states for two reasons. First, the structure of a multi-state population is inherently more complex than that of a single state because of state-to-state transitions. Second, estimates of cross-state correlations of the vital processes are a largely uncharted territory. Unlike multi-state lifetable theory, in forecasting applications the role of directed flows from state to state is often less important than the overall coherence of the assumptions concerning the vital processes. This is the case in the context of the European Union. Thus, a simplified approach is feasible, in which migration is represented by state-specific net numbers of migrants. This allows the use of existing single-state software, when simulations are suitably organized, in a multi-state setting. To address the second problem, we provide empirical estimates of cross-country covariances in the forecast uncertainty of fertility, mortality, and net migration. Together with point forecasts of these parameters that are coherent across countries, this produces coherent forecasts for aggregates of countries. The finding is that models for intermediate correlations are necessary for a proper accounting of forecast uncertainty at the aggregate level, in this case the European Union. ?? 2008 International Institute of Forecasters.},

abstract = {Projecting populations that have sparse or unreliable data, such as those of many developing countries, presents a challenge to demographers. The assumptions that they make to project data-poor populations frequently fall into the realm of "educated guesses," and the resulting projections, often regarded as forecasts, are valid only to the extent that the assumptions on which they are based reasonably represent the past or future, as the case may be. These traditional projection techniques do not incorporate a demographer's assessment of uncertainty in the assumptions. Addressing the challenges of forecasting a data-poor population, we project the Iraqi Kurdish population using a Bayesian approach. This approach incorporates a demographer's uncertainty about past and future characteristics of the population in the form of elicited prior distributions.},

@article{Raleigh2007,
abstract = {Climate change is expected to bring about major change in freshwater availability, the productive capacity of soils, and in patterns of human settlement. However, considerable uncertainties exist with regard to the extent and geographical distribution of these changes. Predicting scenarios for how climate-related environmental change may influence human societies and political systems necessarily involves an even higher degree of uncertainty. The direst predictions about the impacts of global warming warn about greatly increased risks of violent conflict over increasingly scarce resources such as freshwater and arable land. We argue that our best guess about the future has to be based on our knowledge about the relationship between demography, environment and violent conflict in the past. Previous rigorous studies in the field have mostly focused on national-level aggregates. This article represents a new approach to assess the impact of environment on internal armed conflict by using georeferenced (GIS) data and small geographical, rather than political, units of analysis. It addresses some of the most important factors assumed to be strongly influenced by global warming: land degradation, freshwater availability, and population density and change. While population growth and density are associated with increased risks, the effects of land degradation and water scarcity are weak, negligible or insignificant. The results indicate that the effects of political and economic factors far outweigh those between local level demographic/environmental factors and conflict. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Xiang2003,
abstract = {Abstract This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the policies pursued by the People's Republic of China (PRC) regarding the emigration of Chinese nationals. Most of the available literature on migration management has focused on receiving countries. With a few exceptions, little attention has been directed at migration management policies pursued in countries of origin. In the case of the PRC, policies regarding overseas Chinese have been fairly well documented and researched, but very little has been written about how the Chinese authorities manage ongoing emigration flows. This gap becomes particularly salient as the importance of the "partnership with the countries of origin" in devising migration policies is being increasingly acknowledged by receiving countries in Europe (Commission of the European Communities, 2000). Over the last 20 years, there have been significant changes in the Chinese Government's policies and perspectives on emigration. But, just like most other governments, the Chinese authorities do not have a single blanket policy covering all categories of emigrants. Emigration is normally managed on a case-by-case basis and the Government's attitude toward the same type of emigration may vary depending on different cases and circumstances. Because of this, this article examines China's major emigration-related policy spheres one by one. Specifically, six issues will be discussed: (1) exit control; (2) diaspora policy; (3) student migration; (4) labour export; (5) regulations on emigration agencies and, finally (6) the Government's response to human smuggling. This article shows both the coherence and the fragmentation in China's policies toward emigration. The coherence is due to the fact that all the policies are inherently linked to China's overall economic and social development strategy. The emigration management regime is sometimes fragmented partly because emigration consists of different streams and is handled by different Government departments, partly because some emigration issues (such as regulations on emigration agents) are very new for the Chinese Government and the authorities are still exploring them. Overall, the Chinese authorities increasingly see emigration as a means to enhance China's integration to the world and are keen to avoid conflicts with the international community over migration issues. At the same time, China's emigration policies need to be more balanced, in particular, the emigration of unskilled labour should be given more priority.},

abstract = {Most of the research on the intraurban migration attempting to develop models of the mobility process has presented intuitively appealing statements about the residential decision process, but stopped short of a formal development of these concepts. If it is to be possible to predict the mobility pattern within the city, both the search and selection process must be more clearly specified. In this paper, a preliminary theoretical model containing decision rules similar to those found in optimal search models is developed. The model explicitly incorporates the spatial and temporal aspects of residential choice and has the potential to predict the probability that a prospective migrant will search for a new residence in a given area of the city, the time when the search process will come to a conclusion and, by implication, the expected location of the new residence. The preliminary results from the model suggest a major elaboration of the spatial and temporal aspects of residential choice under conditions of uncertainty in terms of a set of empirically measurable determinants, relating to a household's preferences, beliefs, and degree of risk aversion.},

abstract = {Long-term scenarios play an important role in research on global environmental change. The climate change research community is developing new scenarios integrating future changes in climate and society to investigate climate impacts as well as options for mitigation and adaptation. One component of these new scenarios is a set of alternative futures of societal development known as the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs). The conceptual framework for the design and use of the SSPs calls for the development of global pathways describing the future evolution of key aspects of society that would together imply a range of challenges for mitigating and adapting to climate change. Here we present one component of these pathways: the SSP narratives, a set of five qualitative descriptions of future changes in demographics, human development, economy and lifestyle, policies and institutions, technology, and environment and natural resources. We describe the methods used to develop the narratives as well as how these pathways are hypothesized to produce particular combinations of challenges to mitigation and adaptation. Development of the narratives drew on expert opinion to (1) identify key determinants of these challenges that were essential to incorporate in the narratives and (2) combine these elements in the narratives in a manner consistent with scholarship on their inter-relationships. The narratives are intended as a description of plausible future conditions at the level of large world regions that can serve as a basis for integrated scenarios of emissions and land use, as well as climate impact, adaptation and vulnerability analyses.},

abstract = {The future paths of population ageing result from specific combinations of declining fertility and increasing life expectancies in different parts of the world. Here we measure the speed of population ageing by using conventional measures and new ones that take changes in longevity into account for the world as a whole and for 13 major regions. We report on future levels of indicators of ageing and the speed at which they change. We show how these depend on whether changes in life expectancy are taken into account. We also show that the speed of ageing is likely to increase over the coming decades and to decelerate in most regions by mid-century. All our measures indicate a continuous ageing of the world's population throughout the century. The median age of the world's population increases from 26.6 years in 2000 to 37.3 years in 2050 and then to 45.6 years in 2100, when it is not adjusted for longevity increase. When increases in life expectancy are taken into account, the adjusted median age rises from 26.6 in 2000 to 31.1 in 2050 and only to 32.9 in 2100, slightly less than what it was in the China region in 2005. There are large differences in the regional patterns of ageing. In North America, the median age adjusted for life expectancy change falls throughout almost the entire century, whereas the conventional median age increases significantly. Our assessment of trends in ageing is based on new probabilistic population forecasts. The probability that growth in the world's population will end during this century is 88{\%}, somewhat higher than previously assessed. After mid-century, lower rates of population growth are likely to coincide with slower rates of ageing.},

However, our variant differs from PDIO in its 'goodness-of-fit' term. Unlike AIC and PDIO, which require the computation of the observed-data empirical log-likelihood, our criterion can be evaluated using only complete-data tools, readily available through the EM algorithm and the SEM ('supplemented' EM) algorithm of Meng and Rubin (Journal of the American Statistical Association 86 (1991) 899{\^{a}}€“909). We compare the performance of our AIC variant to that of both AIC and PDIO in simulations where the data being modeled contains missing values. The results indicate that our criterion is less prone to overfitting than AIC and less prone to underfitting than PDIO.},

We define two kinds of homeostatic relationships among these components: fertility responses to mortality change (type I) and migration responses to changes in net reproduction (type II), and show that both can be observed to some degree in this period. We examine the extent of cohort replacement embodied in the medium-variant UN population projections over 2010–2100 and consider how the international migration assumptions made in such projections would be affected by a homeostatic perspective.},

to the updated Second Edition, which continues to provide a definitive
unified, treatment of methods for the analysis of diverse types of
data. Today, it remains popular for its clarity, richness of content
and direct relevance to agricultural, biological, health, engineering,
and other applications.The authors focus on examining the way a response
variable depends on a combination of explanatory variables, treatment,
and classification variables. They give particular emphasis to the
important case where the dependence occurs through some unknown,
linear combination of the explanatory variables.The Second Edition
includes topics added to the core of the first edition, including
conditional and marginal likelihood methods, estimating equations,
and models for dispersion effects and components of dispersion. The
discussion of other topics-log-linear and related models, log odds-ratio
regression models, multinomial response models, inverse linear and
related models, quasi-likelihood functions, and model checking-was
expanded and incorporates significant revisions.Comprehension of
the material requires simply a knowledge of matrix theory and the
basic ideas of probability theory, but for the most part, the book
is self-contained. Therefore, with its worked examples, plentiful
exercises, and topics of direct use to researchers in many disciplines,
Generalized Linear Models serves as ideal text, self-study guide,

abstract = {Background: The county-to-county migration data of the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) is an incredible resource for understanding migration in the United States. Produced annually since 1990 in conjunction with the US Census Bureau, the IRS migration data represents 95{\%} to 98{\%} of the tax-ﬁling universe and their dependents, making the IRS migration data one of the largest sources of migration data. However, any analysis using the IRS migration data must process at least seven legacy formats of this public data across more than 2000 data ﬁles – a serious burden for migration scholars. Objective: To produce a single, ﬂat data ﬁle containing complete county-to-county IRS migration ﬂow data and to make the computer code to process the migration data freely available. Methods: This paper uses R to process more than 2,000 IRS migration ﬁles into a single, ﬂat data ﬁle for use in migration research. Contribution: To encourage and facilitate the use of this data, we provide a single, standardized, ﬂat data ﬁle containing county-to-county one-year migration ﬂows for the period 1990–2010 (containing 163,883 dyadic county pairs resulting in 3.2 million county-year observations totaling over 343 million migrants) and provide the full R script to download, process, and ﬂatten the IRS migration data.},

Using aggregate daily patterns of Foursquare checkins, our methods extract similar patterns from Twitter, extending the amount of available content while preserving high relevance. We devise and test several methods to extract such content, using timeseries and semantic similarity. Evaluating on key activity categories available from Foursquare (coffee, food, shopping and nightlife), we show that our extraction methods are able to capture equivalent patterns in Twitter. By examining rudimentary categories of activity such as nightlife, food or shopping we peek at the fundamental rhythm of human behavior and observe when it is disrupted.

While users typically realize that sharing locations has some implications for their privacy, we provide evidence that many (i) are unaware of the full scope of the threat they face when doing so, and (ii) often do not even realize when they publish such information. The threat is elevated by recent developments that make systematic search for specific geo-located data and inference from multiple sources easier than ever before. In this paper, we summarize the state of geo-tagging; estimate the amount of geo-information available on several major sites, including YouTube, Twitter, and Craigslist; and examine its programmatic accessibility through public APIs. We then present a set of scenarios demonstrating how easy it is to correlate geo-tagged data with corresponding publicly-available information for compromising a victim's privacy. We were, e.g., able to find private addresses of celebrities as well as the origins of otherwise anonymized Craigslist postings. We argue that the security and privacy community needs to shape the further development of geo-location technology for better protecting users from such consequences.},

abstract = {Why is the birth rate so low? How fast is the population ageing? What is the true picture of immigration into Britain? This is the only textbook which offers students a complete picture of Britain's population structure. It follows a synthetic approach to focus on the more important and interesting developments and so builds up an integrated picture of the British demographic scene. It offers an informed discussion of such issues as the problems of paying for a growing pensioner population, shortages of young workers, the high rates of divorce and illegitimate birth, geographical and social differences in health and mortality trends. Significant changes are taking place in the composition and distribution of the British people through immigration from the New Commonwealth and elsewhere, movement between town and country, and between North and South. The authors explain how and why these changes have occurred. They describe the development of all these patterns and trends in the British population during the twentieth century, and suggest what the future may hold. At a time of EC integration, it is important to know how distinctive the British population is. The authors place British trends in an international context through frequent comparisons with Europe, the United States, and other industrial countries. The comprehensiveness and detail with which these issues are dealt will make the book required reading for undergraduate students in departments of geography, demography, labour economics, and town and regional planning, and for businesses interested in understanding the causes of the growth and decline of their labour force and market.},

abstract = {The power of places to draw migrants is a topic of fundamental interest in geograhical and related social studies and also in policy circles. This paper describes and demonstrates the utility of a measure of migration attractivity which is considered superior to those most widely used previously. Following a review of the importance now attached to measuring place attractiveness, the paper documents the deficiences of the most commonly used methods involving numbers and rates of inmigration and net migration. It goes on to argue for a measure of the relative intrinsic attractivity (RIA) of places which takes account of the spatial context of each place in terms of its accessibility from all the other places that are 'at risk' of supplying residents to it. It applies this approach to migration that took place in 1990-91 between all the local authority districts of mainland Britain, as recorded by the 1991 Census. The resultant ranking of these 451 places on the basis of their migration attractivity for all persons is compared with the patterns indicated by more traditional measures. The paper then explores the characteristics of places to see what features are most closely associated with high and low levels of migration attractivity. Finally, RIA scores are calculated separately for two age groups thought to have different views about what makes for an attractive place to live, namely young adults, and people at the peak of the family-building stage of their lives.

abstract = {Objectives. We investigate how much state-to-state elderly migration patterns have changed during 1970–2000 and compare the findings from 2 commonly used sources of data, the census flow tabulations and the integrated public use microdata series (IPUMS). Methods. We calculate descriptive statistics such as migration rates, the distribution of top destination and origin states, and a new migration Herfindahl–Hirschman Index that measures geographic concentration. Comparisons over time and between data sources are formalized using correlations and regression analyses that permit persistent flow patterns. Results. After an increase between 1970 and 1980, elderly migration rates have been stable, with a slight decline. Elderly migration has become less geographically concentrated; the decline of California and Florida and ascension of Nevada and the Carolinas as top destinations are evident. Correlation and regression analyses reveal that migration patterns are overall very persistent over time, especially using census tabulations based on a larger sample. Discussion. Elderly migration patterns have been quite stable since 1970. Using the IPUMS, as most migration studies do, exaggerates the changes in elderly migration over time in both descriptive and statistical analyses, a result that is likely due to its smaller sample size and the relative rarity of an interstate move.},

abstract = {Continental migration studies range from elaborate recording of periodic migration data to regression analysis to statistical models that may combine several sources of quantitative and qualitative data. It is the writer's observation that continuous mathematical modeling has not been attempted to estimate continental migration because of the complexity of the governing mathematical models. In this study the writer proposes a continuous mathematical model to estimate continental population and migration trends. The proposed model is based on knowledge-based population dynamics model developed earlier which was used to estimate global population levels and stability of world population under various stress scenarios. In this study one of these models are extended to include continental population and continental migration concepts. Resulting mathematical model is calibrated using historical continental population data which is a reliable data source. If historical continental migration is a zero-sum process, the outcome of the calibrated model yields continental population growth and intercontinental migration estimates. Results obtained are in line with global projections that are made in other studies. The proposed model is also used for future projections.},

In this paper we focus on the importance of decisions made with regard to the model specifi cations adopted. We compare the forecasts and prediction intervals associated with four simple regional population projection models: an overall growth rate model, a component model with net migration, a component model with in-migration and out-migration rates, and a multiregional model with destinationspecifi c out-migration rates. Vector autoregressive models are used to forecast future rates of growth, birth, death, net migration, in-migration and out-migration, and destinationspecifi c out-migration for the North, Midlands, and South regions in England. They are also used to forecast diff erent international migration measures. The base data represent a time series of annual data provided by the Offi ce for National Statistics from 1976 to 2008. The results illustrate how both the forecasted subpopulation totals and the corresponding prediction intervals diff er for the multiregional model in comparison to other simpler models, as well as for diff erent assumptions about international migration.

abstract = {In this paper, we report preliminary results from an ongoing effort to improve data on bilateral migration stocks, and set out some working hypotheses on the determinants and socioeconomic implications of South-South migration drawing on a survey of the lit- erature.We estimate that 74 million, or nearly half, of the migrants from developing coun- tries reside in other developing countries. In other words, South-South migration is nearly as large as South-North migration. Almost 80 percent of South-South migration is esti- mated to take place between countries with contiguous borders,and most appears to occur between countries with relatively small differences in income. Estimates of South-South remittances range from 10 to 29 percent of developing countries' remittance receipts in 2005, depending on the allocation rule chosen to estimate bilateral flows. The impact of South-South migration on the income of migrants and natives is smaller than for South- North migration. However, even small increases in income can have substantial welfare implications for the poor, and cross-migration can improve the match between skills and requirements in the countries involved, thus raising efficiency and welfare. The costs of South-South remittances (where such remittances are permitted) are even higher than those of North-South remittances, because of lack of competition in the remittance mar- ket, a lack of financial development in general, and high foreign exchange commissions at both ends of the transaction. These findings suggest that policymakers should pay atten- tion to the complex challenges that developing countries face not only as the countries of origin of migrants, but also as destinations. Designing appropriate policies, however, will require considerable efforts to improve data, and careful analysis of the socioeconomic impact of migration on wages, income distribution, gender, health, and migrants' rights. The data sets on bilateral migration stocks and bilateral remittance flows worldwide are posted at www.worldbank.org/prospects/migrationandremittances.},

abstract = {Official population projections are often based on cohort component
methods in which migration levels or rates enter exogenously. When
net migration accounts for a large proportion of population change
and fluctuates strongly, more reliable population forecasts can be
derived by explicitly forecasting migration first. This article focuses
on forecasting migration between Australia and New Zealand (trans-Tasman
migration), which is largely visa-free and therefore resembles internal
migration. Net trans-Tasman migration is a major component of New
Zealand population change and is embedded in this article in a Bayesian
or unrestricted vector autoregression (VAR) model, which includes
foreign and domestic economic variables. When time series of net
migration are available, this approach provides a useful input into
forecasting population growth in the short run in the absence of
major policy changes. This conclusion applies equally to interregional
migration and to unrestricted international migration between economically

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 Guy J. Abel. BACKGROUND Little attention is given to the role of migration in global population projection models. Most demographers set future levels of net migration on trajectories towards zero in all countries, nullifying the impact of migration on long-run projected populations. Yet as fertility and mortality rates fall, the role of migration on future population change is becoming more pronounced. OBJECTIVES In this paper we develop future long-run migration scenarios to provide a range of possible outcomes. METHODS Our alternative migration scenarios are linked to the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP), widely used in research on global environmental change. These are utilized as inputs for a global cohort component projection model to obtain population totals up until 2100 for all countries. CONTRIBUTION The results illustrate the important role of migration assumptions in long-run projections, especially in post-demographic-transition countries. Further, they provide plausible alternatives to projections based on the commonly used, but poorly justified, convergence towards a zero net migration assumption.},

abstract = {During the past few decades, technologies such as remote sensing, geographical information systems, and global positioning systems have transformed the way the distribution of human population is studied and modeled in space and time. However, the mapping of populations remains constrained by the logistics of censuses and surveys. Consequently, spatially detailed changes across scales of days, weeks, or months, or even year to year, are difficult to assess and limit the application of human population maps in situations in which timely information is required, such as disasters, conflicts, or epidemics. Mobile phones (MPs) now have an extremely high penetration rate across the globe, and analyzing the spatiotemporal distribution of MP calls geolocated to the tower level may overcome many limitations of census-based approaches, provided that the use of MP data is properly assessed and calibrated. Using datasets of more than 1 billion MP call records from Portugal and France, we show how spatially and temporarily explicit estimations of population densities can be produced at national scales, and how these estimates compare with outputs produced using alternative human population mapping methods. We also demonstrate how maps of human population changes can be produced over multiple timescales while preserving the anonymity of MP users. With similar data being collected every day by MP network providers across the world, the prospect of being able to map contemporary and changing human population distributions over relatively short intervals exists, paving the way for new applications and a near real-time understanding of patterns and processes in human geography.},

abstract = {In recent decades, life expectancy in developed countries has risen to historically unprecedented levels driven by unforeseen declines in rates of mortality. The prospects of further reductions are of fundamental importance in various areas. In this context, we consider the problem of forecasting future mortality and life expectancy in the event of a structural change. We show how recent advances in statistical testing for structural changes can be used to arrive at properly specified models for the general level of mortality in the context of the Lee-Carter model. Specifically, the results of tests for a change in the trend of the index of mortality and for the presence of a unit root are used to identify appropriate forecasting models. The methodology proposed is applied to post-1950 mortality data for a set of developed countries to test the usual assumption that is made in the literature of a sustained decline in mortality at roughly constant rates in this period. Structural changes in the rate of decline in overall mortality are found for almost every country, especially in male populations. We also illustrate how accounting for such a change can lead to a major effect in mortality and life expectancy forecasts over the next decades.},

abstract = {Despite their importance for urban planning, traffic forecasting and the spread of biological and mobile viruses, our understanding of the basic laws governing human motion remains limited owing to the lack of tools to monitor the time-resolved location of individuals. Here we study the trajectory of 100,000 anonymized mobile phone users whose position is tracked for a six-month period. We find that, in contrast with the random trajectories predicted by the prevailing L{\'{e}}vy flight and random walk models, human trajectories show a high degree of temporal and spatial regularity, each individual being characterized by a time-independent characteristic travel distance and a significant probability to return to a few highly frequented locations. After correcting for differences in travel distances and the inherent anisotropy of each trajectory, the individual travel patterns collapse into a single spatial probability distribution, indicating that, despite the diversity of their travel history, humans follow simple reproducible patterns. This inherent similarity in travel patterns could impact all phenomena driven by human mobility, from epidemic prevention to emergency response, urban planning and agent-based modelling. {\textcopyright}2008 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {The objective of this case study was to obtain some first-hand information about the functional consequences of a cosmetic tongue split operation for speech and tongue motility. One male patient who had performed the operation on himself was interviewed and underwent a tongue motility assessment, as well as an ultrasound examination. Tongue motility was mildly reduced as a result of tissue scarring. Speech was rated to be fully intelligible and highly acceptable by 4 raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional ultrasound demonstrated that the synergy of the 2 sides of the tongue was preserved. A notably deep posterior genioglossus furrow indicated compensation for the reduced length of the tongue blade. It is concluded that the tongue split procedure did not significantly affect the participant's speech intelligibility and tongue motility.},

abstract = {Nowadays, demographers, population statisticians, and population forecasters have richer data, more refined theories of demographic behavior, and more sophisticated methods of analysis than they had two or three decades ago. This scientific progress should have made it easier to predict demographic behavior. But analyses of the errors in older forecasts show that demographic forecasts published by statistical agencies in 14 European countries have not become more accurate over the past 25 years. The findings demonstrate that scientific progress in population studies during the previous two to three decades has not kept up with the trend toward less predictable demographic behavior of populations in European countries. There is no reason to be more optimistic about US Census Bureau forecasts. Population forecasts are intrinsically uncertain, hence should be couched in probabilistic terms.},

Recent United Kingdom and Irish fertility curves show 'distortions' in terms of a 'bulge' in early age fertility, distinct from the smoother curves of other European countries. These patterns may not be adequately described by mathematical functions used by previous studies to model fertility curves. A mixture model with two component distributions may be more appropriate. The suitability of the simple and mixture Hadwiger functions is examined in relation to the fertility curves of a number of European countries. While the simple Hadwiger model fits recent period age-specific fertility distributions for some countries, others which display a 'bulge' in early age fertility distributions for some countries, others which display a 'bulg' in early age fertility require a mixture Hadwiger model. Some of the parameters of the Hadwiger models appear to be related to familiar demographic indices. The simple and mixture Hadwiger models appear useful in describing and comparing fertility patterns across European countries.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Millennium Development Goal 4 calls for an annual rate of reduction (ARR) of the under-five mortality rate (U5MR) of 4.4{\%} between 1990 and 2015. Progress is measured through the point estimates of the United Nations Inter-agency Group for Child Mortality Estimation (UN IGME). To facilitate evidence-based conclusions about progress toward the goal, we assessed the uncertainty in the estimates arising from sampling errors and biases in data series and the inferior quality of specific data series.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS AND FINDINGS: We implemented a bootstrap procedure to construct 90{\%} uncertainty intervals (UIs) for the U5MR and ARR to complement the UN IGME estimates. We constructed the bounds for all countries without a generalized HIV epidemic, where a standard estimation approach is carried out (174 countries). In the bootstrap procedure, potential biases in levels and trends of data series of different source types were accounted for. There is considerable uncertainty about the U5MR, particularly for high mortality countries and in recent years. Among 86 countries with a U5MR of at least 40 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1990, the median width of the UI, relative to the U5MR level, was 19{\%} for 1990 and 48{\%} for 2011, with the increase in uncertainty due to more limited data availability. The median absolute width of the 90{\%} UI for the ARR from 1990 to 2011 was 2.2{\%}. Although the ARR point estimate for all high mortality countries was greater than zero, for eight of them uncertainty included the possibility of no improvement between 1990 and 2011. For 13 countries, it is deemed likely that the ARR from 1990 to 2011 exceeded 4.4{\%}.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: In light of the upcoming evaluation of Millennium Development Goal 4 in 2015, uncertainty assessments need to be taken into account to avoid unwarranted conclusions about countries' progress based on limited data.},

First, among the various spatial models used, the model linking migrations to the zoning of the territory provides a simple summary of this relationship, but its parameters do not have a clear plain language meaning for international comparison. Second, the «migrant-migration» model derives an instantaneous rate based on migrant numbers measured over variable durations that is independent of multiple and return moves occurring over a longer interval. International comparison is thus only possible for the instantaneous mobility rate (change of residence), a standard indicator whose meaning is clear. The authors use numerous examples to show that the simultaneous use of both types of models provides a means, under certain conditions, to approximate such a rate, that can be linked to the parameters of these models. The validity of these models can be tested and confirmed using data from countries where direct measures of changes of residence are available.{\textcopyright} 2013 I.N.E.D. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Administrative data sources are an important component of population data collection and they have been used in census data production in the Nordic countries since the 1960s. A large amount of information about the population is already collected in administrative data sources by governments. However, there are some challenges to using administrative data sources to estimate population counts by age, sex, and geographical area as well as population characteristics. The main limitation with the administrative data sources is that they only collect information from a subset of the population about specific events, and this may result in either undercoverage or overcoverage of the population. Another issue with the administrative data sources is that the information may not have the same quality for all population groups. This research aims to correct an inaccurate administrative data source by combining aggregate-level administrative data with more accurate marginal distributions or two-way marginal information from an auxiliary data source and produce accurate population estimates in the absence of a traditional census. The methodology developed is applied to estimate population counts by age, sex, and local authority area in England and Wales. The administrative data source used is the Patient Register which suffers from overcoverage, particularly for people between the ages of 20 and 50.},

abstract = {Background: International migration flow data often lack adequate measurements of volume, direction and completeness. These pitfalls limit empirical comparative studies of migration and cross national population projections to use net migration measures or inadequate data. Objective: This paper aims to address these issues at a global level, presenting estimates of bilateral flow tables between 191 countries. Methods: A methodology to estimate flow tables of migration transitions for the globe is illustrated in two parts. First, a methodology to derive flows from sequential stock tables is developed. Second, the methodology is applied to recently released World Bank migration stock tables between 1960 and 2000 ({\"{O}}zden et al. 2011) to estimate a set of four decadal global migration flow tables. Results: The results of the applied methodology are discussed with reference to comparable estimates of global net migration flows of the United Nations and models for international migration flows. Comments: The proposed methodology adds to the limited existing literature on linking migration flows to stocks. The estimated flow tables represent a first-of-a-kind set of comparable global origin destination flow data.},

abstract = {Recent outbreaks of Ebola and Dengue viruses have again elevated the significance of the capability to quickly predict disease spread in an emergent situation. However, existing approaches usually rely heavily on the time-consuming census processes, or the privacy-sensitive call logs, leading to their unresponsive nature when facing the abruptly changing dynamics in the event of an outbreak. In this paper we study the feasibility of using large-scale Twitter data as a proxy of human mobility to model and predict disease spread. We report that for Australia, Twitter users' distribution correlates well the census-based population distribution, and that the Twitter users' travel patterns appear to loosely follow the gravity law at multiple scales of geographic distances, i.e. national level, state level and metropolitan level. The radiation model is also evaluated on this dataset though it has shown inferior fitness as a result of Australia's sparse population and large landmass. The outcomes of the study form the cornerstones for future work towards a model-based, responsive prediction method from Twitter data for disease spread.},

abstract = {The most basic economic theory suggests that rising incomes in developing countries will deter emigration from those countries, an idea that captivates policymakers in international aid and trade diplomacy. A lengthy literature and recent data suggest something quite different: that over the course of a “mobility transition”, emigration generally rises with economic development until countries reach upper-middle income, and only thereafter falls. This note quantifies the shape of the mobility transition in every decade since 1960. It then briefly surveys 45 years of research, which has yielded six classes of theory to explain the mobility transition and numerous tests of its existence and characteristics in both macro- and micro-level data. The note concludes by suggesting five questions that require further study.},

and analysing Bayesian full probability models. Models may be specified

software offers a user-interface, based on dialogue boxes and menu
commands, through which the model may then be analysed using Markov
chain Monte Carlo techniques. In this paper we discuss how and why
various modern computing concepts, such as object-orientation and
run-time linking, feature in the software's design. We also discuss
how the framework may be extended. It is possible to write specific
applications that form an apparently seamless interface with WinBUGS
for users with specialized requirements. It is also possible to interface
with WinBUGS at a lower level by incorporating new object types that
may be used by WinBUGS without knowledge of the modules in which
they are implemented. Neither of these types of extension require
access to, or even recompilation of, the WinBUGS source-code.},

@article{Deng2015,
abstract = {China has been experiencing an unprecedented urbanization process. In 2011, China's urban population reached 691 million with an urbanization rate of 51.27{\%}. Urbanization level is expected to increase to 70{\%} in China in 2030, reflecting the projection that nearly 300 million people would migrate from rural areas to urban areas over this period. At the same time, the total fertility rate of China's population is declining due to the combined effect of economic growth, environmental carrying capacity, and modern social consciousness. The Chinese government has loosened its "one-child policy" gradually by allowing childbearing couples to have the second child as long as either of them is from a one-child family. In such rapidly developing country, the natural growth and spatial migration will consistently reshape spatial pattern of population. An accurate prediction of the future spatial pattern of population and its evolution trend are critical to key policy-making processes and spatial planning in China including urbanization, land use development, ecological conservation and environmental protection. In this paper, a top-down method is developed to project the spatial distribution of China's future population with considerations of both natural population growth at provincial level and the provincial migration from 2010 to 2050. Building on this, the spatial pattern and evolution trend of Chinese provincial population are analyzed. The results suggested that the overall spatial pattern of Chinese population will be unlikely changed in next four decades, with the east area having the highest population density and followed by central area, northeast and west area. Four provinces in the east, Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin and Jiangsu, will remain the top in terms of population density in China, and Xinjiang, Qinghai and Tibet will continue to have the lowest density of population. We introduced an index system to classify the Chinese provinces into three categories in terms of provincial population densities: Fast Changing Populated Region (FCPR), Low Changing Populated Region (LCPR) and Inactive Populated Region (IPR). In the FCPR, China's population is projected to continue to concentrate in net immigration leading type (NILT) area where receives nearly 99{\%} of new accumulated floating population. Population densities of Shanghai, Beijing, Zhejiang will peak in 2030, while the population density in Guangdong will keep increasing until 2035. Net emigration leading type (NELT) area will account for 75{\%} of emigration population, including Henan, Anhui, Chongqing and Hubei. Natural growth will play a dominant role in natural growth leading type area, such as Liaoning and Shandong, because there will be few emigration population. Due to the large amount of moving-out labors and gradually declining fertility rates, population density of the LCPR region exhibits a downward trend, except for Fujian and Hainan. The majority of the western provinces will be likely to remain relatively low population density, with an average value of no more than 100 persons per km(2).},

We argue that the value of the rural registration influences migrants' decision-making and identities by creating a cost to registration transfer to the city, and that the rural land system interacts with the household registration system to inhibit migrant integration. We test novel hypotheses derived from a simple model of migrant integration, finding connections between rural sending area factors and migrant integration in the city. We test these hypotheses using survey data from two surveys of rural-to-urban migrant workers and publicly available economic data. We find that migrants from areas with higher levels of economic development are less likely to desire registration transfer to the city. We also find that landholding and weaker rural and rights are associated with lower levels of social integration in the city.},

We conduct our analysis in three strands to differentiate migration: (1) amongst Asian countries, (2) from Asian countries to destinations outside the region, and (3) towards Asian countries from elsewhere in the world. After controlling for demographic, geographic and socio-economic variables, we find that large countries are important senders of migrants but not so for receiving migrants, distance has nearly the same effect for moves within Asia and for moves to countries outside the region, and Gross Domestic Product per capita in the destination is important for moves within Asia.},

Discusses design, formulation, and calibration of spatial interaction models. Explores the relationship between micro and macro models of spatial interaction, the former focusing on the behavior of the individual making spatial choices and the latter focusing on aggregate flows between places. Demonstrates the applicability of spatial interaction models in demographic analysis, in predicting market shares of retail outlets, and in forecasting complex trip patterns within cities. Formulates a consistent optimization framework to represent an interaction based, location-allocation model, and presents a solution procedure. Addresses the problem of positioning air terminals and express delivery sorting centers so as to connect cities in a network efficiently.

abstract = {This paper introduces four versions of an international bilateral migration stock database for 226 by 226 countries and territories. The first three versions each consist of two matrices, the first containing migrants defined by country of birth, i.e. the foreign-born population, the second, by nationality, i.e. the foreign population. Wherever possible, the information is collected from the 2000 round of censuses, though older data are included where this information was unavailable. The first version of the matrices contains as much data as could be collated at the time of writing but also contains gaps. The later versions progressively employ a variety of techniques to estimate the missing data. The final matrix, comprising only the foreign-born, attempts to reconcile all of the available information to provide the researcher with a single and complete matrix of international bilateral migrant stocks. The final section of the paper describes some of the patterns evident in the database. Key},

abstract = {Mobile phone datasets allow for the analysis of human behavior on an unprecedented scale. The social network, temporal dynamics and mobile behavior of mobile phone users have often been analyzed independently from each other using mobile phone datasets. In this article, we explore the connections between various features of human behavior extracted from a large mobile phone dataset. Our observations are based on the analysis of communication data of 100,000 anonymized and randomly chosen individuals in a dataset of communications in Portugal. We show that clustering and principal component analysis allow for a significant dimension reduction with limited loss of information. The most important features are related to geographical location. In particular, we observe that most people spend most of their time at only a few locations. With the help of clustering methods, we then robustly identify home and office locations and compare the results with official census data. Finally, we analyze the geographic spread of users' frequent locations and show that commuting distances can be reasonably well explained by a gravity model. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.

This paper highlights several of the key challenges involved in efficiently collecting, storing, and analyzing datasets consisting of millions of sparse files with spatial, temporal, and network features. We focus on the computational issues faced in analyzing Call Detail Records (CDRs), the metadata (i.e., log files) passively collected by mobile phone operators about transactions on their telecommunications networks. CDRs and related data provide a rich foundation for research in fields ranging from anthropology and sociology to electrical engineering and urban planning. After describing the data and its challenges, we present our current framework for computational analysis, and discuss opportunities for future work.},

abstract = {We describe a Bayesian projection model to produce country-specific projections of the total fertility rate (TFR) for all countries. The model decomposes the evolution of TFR into three phases: pre-transition high fertility, the fertility transition, and post-transition low fertility. The model for the fertility decline builds on the United Nations Population Division's current deterministic projection methodology, which assumes that fertility will eventually fall below replacement level. It models the decline in TFR as the sum of two logistic functions that depend on the current TFR level, and a random term. A Bayesian hierarchical model is used to project future TFR based on both the country's TFR history and the pattern of all countries. It is estimated from United Nations estimates of past TFR in all countries using a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. The post-transition low fertility phase is modeled using an autoregressive model, in which long-term TFR projections converge toward and oscillate around replacement level. The method is evaluated using out-of-sample projections for the period since 1980 and the period since 1995, and is found to be well calibrated. {\textcopyright} 2011 Population Association of America.},

abstract = {Advances in projecting international migration have been hindered by a lack of ade- quate data. Consequently, international projection-making agencies commonly use simplistic assumptions of net-migration measures derived as residuals from demo- graphic accounting. However, past net migration can be often volatile and introduce bias when projecting populations (Rogers, 1990). This paper presents sets of global population projections to 2060, focusing on two alternative assumptions of interna- tional migration. Assumptions on rates of other demographic factors, namely fertility and mortality, are held constant allowing an examination of the role of international migration in global population projections models. In the first projection, we set the future net number of migrants by age and sex in each country to mirror that of the United Nations. In the second projection, we use a set of estimated 5-year bilateral migration flows by sex developed from the flows from stocks methodology of Abel (2013) and Abel {\&} Sander (2014). The sex-specific bilateral flow table estimates are disaggregated by age using a parametric assumption for emigra- tion schedules, and then summed over rows and columns to obtain immigration and emigration rates by age and sex. These estimates are used as base data in a bi-regional projection model, where immigration and emigration rates are assumed to remain con- stant up to 2060. Our results highlight differences in the future level of populations around the globe and numbers of migrant flows between a net migration projection model and a bi- regional projection model.},

As a solution, we propose a technique for calculating adjusted crosstabulations from log-linear results. Our solution provides a more intuitive and comprehensible method for presenting and discussing results, especially for resolving the issue of absolute versus relative comparisons. As an illustration, we analyze a data set on unemployment, using polytomous dependent and independent variables.

Similarly a realist stance, as advocated by Sayer (1992), leads to a mixing of methods in order to carry out the synthesising tasks expected of geographers. Postmodernism, when interpreted as method, also points the researcher to consider adopting flexible research practices in order to capture the multiplicities of meaning associated with migration and place.

abstract = {A methodology is developed to estimate comparable international migration flows be- tween a set of countries. International migration flow data may be missing, reported by the sending country, reported by the receiving country or reported by both the sending and receiving countries. For the last situation, reported counts rarely match due to differences in definitions and data collection systems. In this thesis, reported counts are harmonized using correction factors estimated from a constrained optimization procedure. Factors are applied to scale data known to be of a reliable standard, creating an incomplete migra- tion flow table of harmonized values. Cells for which no reliable reported flows exist are then estimated from a negative binomial regression model fitted using the Expectation- Maximization (EM) type algorithm. Covariate information for this model is drawn from international migration theory. Finally, measures of precision for all missing cell estimates are derived using the Supplemented EM algorithm. Recent data on international migra- tion between countries in Europe are used to illustrate the methodology. The results represent a complete table of comparable flows that can be used by regional policy makers and social scientist alike to better understand population behaviour and change.},

Drawing from diverse data sources, we explore migration flows among various economies in East and Southeast Asia between 2000 and 2005 and 2005 and 2010. Our analyses yielded two major findings. First, the relationship between economic factors and the volume of migration flows depends on the overall economy in the region. Second, the findings reveal a consistently robust and significant relationship between geographic proximity and migration flow. Implications of these findings are discussed.},

Two rest on a demographic model for age-structured populations with stochastic fluctuations in vital rates. Two rest on empirical analyses of past forecasts of population sizes of Sweden at five-year intervals from 1780 to 1980 inclusive. Confidence intervals produced by the different methods vary substantially. The relative sizes differ in the various historical periods. The narrowest intervals offer a lower bound on uncertainty about the future. Procedures for estimating a range of confidence intervals are tentatively recommended. A major lesson is that finitely many observations of the past and incomplete theoretical understanding of the present and future can justify at best a range of confidence intervals for population projections. Uncertainty attaches not only to the point forecasts of future population, but also to the estimates of those forecasts' uncertainty.},

abstract = {The projected size and spatial distribution of the future population are important drivers of global change and key determinants of exposure and vulnerability to hazards. Spatial demographic projections are widely used as inputs to spatial projections of land use, energy use, and emissions, as well as to assessments of the impacts of extreme events, sea level rise, and other climate-related outcomes. To date, however, there are very few global-scale, spatially explicit population projections, and those that do exist are often based on simple scaling or trend extrapolation. Here we present a new set of global, spatially explicit population scenarios that are consistent with the new Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) developed to facilitate global change research. We use a parameterized gravity-based downscaling model to produce projections of spatial population change that are quantitatively consistent with national population and urbanization projections for the SSPs and qualitatively consistent with assumptions in the SSP narratives regarding spatial development patterns. We show that the five SSPs lead to substantially different spatial population outcomes at the continental, national, and sub-national scale. In general, grid cell-level outcomes are most influenced by national-level population change, second by urbanization rate, and third by assumptions about the spatial style of development. However, the relative importance of these factors is a function of the magnitude of the projected change in total population and urbanization for each country and across SSPs. We also demonstrate variation in outcomes considering the example of population existing in a low-elevation coastal zone under alternative scenarios.},

Quantifying and modeling human migration can contribute towards a better understanding of the nature of migration and help develop evidence-based interventions for disease control policy, economic development, and resource allocation. In this study we paired census microdata from 10 countries in sub-Saharan Africa with additional spatial datasets to develop models for the internal migration flows in each country, including key drivers that reflect the changing social, demographic, economic, and environmental landscapes. We assessed how well these gravity-type spatial interaction models can both explain and predict migration. Results show that the models can explain up to 87 percent of internal migration, can predict future within-country migration with correlations of up to 0.91, and can also predict migration in other countries with correlations of up to 0.72. Findings show that such models are useful tools for understanding migration as well as predicting flows in regions where data are sparse, and can contribute towards strategic economic development, planning, and disease control targeting.},

abstract = {In the early twenty-first century, the forces generating international migration are more powerful than ever, and human mobility has become a key facet of global integration. Yet public concern about migration also remains powerful. Origin countries fear loss of skills and increased dependency on remittances from destination countries. Many people in destination countries see migration as a threat to prosperity, identity and security. The securitization of migration in the Global North since 2001 ignores the fact that South–North migration is the result of growing global inequality and lack of human security in the South. It is important to understand that migration is a crucial aspect of human development that can improve the capabilities of individuals and the innovation capacity of societies. This essay provides an overview of some of the key issues in international migration, including a discussion of the effects of the global economic crisis. In conclusion, the essay discusses the ‘global governance deficit' in migration and looks at some long-term prospects.},

Even though population ageing will affect all European regions, different regions will be affected in different ways. Even under favorable conditions, 35-40 {\%} of all NUTS2 regions will face a labor force decline. If economic conditions are poor, some regions may continue to grow, but 55-70 {\%} of the regions will see a labor force decline by 10 {\%} or more. In most regions of Eastern Europe, the labor force may decrease by more than 30 {\%}. To keep regions prosperous (maintaining competitiveness) and to avoid worse inequality (maintaining cohesion), policy-makers must find ways to cope with these challenges through new fiscal and social policies, though policies directly affecting demographic and migratory trends may also be needed. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

abstract = {As a typical form of geographical phenomena, spatial flow events have been widely studied in contexts like migration, daily commuting, and information exchange through telecommunication. Studying the spatial pattern of spatial flow data serves to reveal essential information about the underlying process generating the phenomena. Most methods of global clustering pattern detection and local clusters detection analysis are focused on single-location spatial events or fail to preserve the integrity of spatial flow events. In this research a new spatial statistical approach of detecting clustering (clusters) of flow data that extends the classical local K-function, while maintaining the integrity of flow data was introduced. Through the appropriate measurement of spatial proximity relationships between entire flows, the new method successfully upgraded the classical hot spot detection method to the stage of “hot flow” detection. Spatial proximity of flows was measured by a four-dimensional distance. Several specific aspects of the method were discussed to provide evidence of its robustness and expandability, such as the multiscale issue, relative importance control and adaptive scale detection, using a real dataset of vehicle theft and recovery location pairs in Charlotte, NC.},

For decades, China has had large numbers of foreign students, expatriates, returned overseas Chinese, and ethnic Chinese refugees. However, in the past few years, immigration to China has become much more diverse and numerous. Chinese students and scholars abroad return to China in ever greater numbers. Traders and labor migrants from all over the world are attracted by China's trading opportunities, political stability, and prosperity. Middle-class Koreans, Taiwanese, and Southeast Asians are looking for cheaper living costs and better jobs. European, North American, and Australian university graduates travel to China for employment or to start a business. This article asks to what extent government policy making and the formation of immigrant groups and ethnic relations are informed by unique features of China's late socialist society and government, or alternatively, to what extent they follow patterns similar to established developed immigrant countries in Asia, Europe, and North America.},

However, we observe a decrease, from 2000 to 2012, in the percentage of professional migrants, worldwide, who have the United States as their country of destination. The pattern holds for persons with Bachelor's, Master's, and PhD degrees alike, and for individuals with degrees from highly-ranked worldwide universities. Our analysis also reveals the growth of Asia as a major professional migration destination during the past twelve years. Although we see a decline in the share of employment-based migrants going to the United States, our results show a recent rebound in the percentage of international students who choose the United States as their destination.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a technique for parameterizing Leslie transition matrices from simple age and sex population counts, using an implementation of "Wood's Method" [wood]; these matrices can forecast population by age and sex (the "cohort component" method) using simple matrix multiplication and a starting population. Our approach improves on previous methods for creating Leslie matrices in two respects: it eliminates the need to calculate input demographic rates from "raw" data, and our new format for the Leslie matrix more elegantly reveals the population's demographic components of change (fertility, mortality, and migration). The paper is organized around three main themes. First, we describe the underlying algorithm, "Wood's Method," which uses quadratic optimization to fit a transition matrix to age and sex population counts. Second, we use demographic theory to create constraint sets that make the algorithm useable for human populations. Finally, we use the method to forecast 3,120 US counties and show that it holds promise for automating cohort-component forecasts. This paper describes the first published successful application of Wood's method to human populations; it also points to more general promise of constrained optimization techniques in demographic modeling.},

@techreport{salt1993mpe,
abstract = {The discussion of migration and population changes in Europe begins
with an overview of world migration trends and types of migration,
followed by demographic trends in Europe, Eastern Europe, and Southern
Europe. Problems of definition and deficient sources of information
have restricted analysis. Trends in stocks and flows, emigration,
and illegal migration in Western Europe are described. Contributing
factors are outlined in chapters on the Western need for immigrants
and the economic and demographic pressures from Eastern Europe and
the South. Specific chapters are directed to increased asylum seeking
and the challenges of current conditions in Yugoslavia. Present and
proposed immigration policies at the border and among guest workers
are addressed. Asylum policies in Europe will be challenged the most
by conditions in Yugoslavia. Greatly increased movements are possible
pending military and political developments. The East-West migration
appears large at present because of the concentration in relatively
small ethnic groups and in a limited number of destinations such
as Germany. Projected emigration from Eastern Europe using the high
Danish emigration rate of 0.42{\%} would include 1.2 million people.
With the exception of Yugoslavia, these high levels of emigration
from Eastern Europe have not occurred. Large scale migrations are
occurring within the former Soviet Union. Continued outflows of Germans,
Jews, and Armenians are highly likely. The push factors from the
East include declining standards of living and ethnic mobilization.
Europe's main destination countries are Greece, Italy, Spain, and
Portugal. Official remittances in 1989 are estimated at {\$}66 billion,
which would make the trading of labor the second most important trading
commodity after oil. Water scarcity in North African countries is
likely to be a push factor in coming years. The volume of movement
among the highly skilled is likely to stabilize in the near future.
Most first and second generation migrants are in low paid and service
industries. There were 15.4 million legally resident foreigners in
Western Europe in 1991. Of the 13 million in EC countries, about
8 million were non-EC nationals. Germany experienced the largest
increase in foreign population to 5.2 million in 1990. The largest
migration has been from traditional emigration countries of Southern
Europe (Italy, Portugal, Spain, and Greece) and from Turkey and Yugoslavia.
More recent migrants have come from North Africa.},

abstract = {In the past decade, large scale mobile phone data have become available for the study of human movement patterns. These data hold an immense promise for understanding human behavior on a vast scale, and with a precision and accuracy never before possible with censuses, surveys or other existing data collection techniques. There is already a significant body of literature that has made key inroads into understanding human mobility using this exciting new data source, and there have been several different measures of mobility used. However, existing mobile phone based mobility measures are inconsistent, inaccurate, and confounded with social characteristics of local context. New measures would best be developed immediately as they will influence future studies of mobility using mobile phone data. In this article, we do exactly this. We discuss problems with existing mobile phone based measures of mobility and describe new methods for measuring mobility that address these concerns. Our measures of mobility, which incorporate both mobile phone records and detailed GIS data, are designed to address the spatial nature of human mobility, to remain independent of social characteristics of context, and to be comparable across geographic regions and time. We also contribute a discussion of the variety of uses for these new measures in developing a better understanding of how human mobility influences micro-level human behaviors and well-being, and macro-level social organization and change.},

A major cause of migration is the growing inequality in incomes and human security between more- and less-devleoped countries. Further driving factors include uneven economic development; rapid demographic transitions; and technological advances in transport and communications. Increasingly migrants do not shift their social existence from one society to another, but maintain trasnnational connctions. The global economic crisis since 2008 has brought a hiatus in some of these factors, but has not undermind their long term significance.

abstract = {Human mobility is fundamental to understanding global issues in the health and social sciences such as disease spread and displacements from disasters and conflicts. Detailed mobility data across spatial and temporal scales are difficult to collect, however, with movements varying from short, repeated movements to work or school, to rare migratory movements across national borders. While typical sources of mobility data such as travel history surveys and GPS tracker data can inform different typologies of movement, almost no source of readily obtainable data can address all types of movement at once. Here, we collect Google Location History (GLH) data and examine it as a novel source of information that could link fine scale mobility with rare, long distance and international trips, as it uniquely spans large temporal scales with high spatial granularity. These data are passively collected by Android smartphones, which reach increasingly broad audiences, becoming the most common operating system for accessing the Internet worldwide in 2017. We validate GLH data against GPS tracker data collected from Android users in the United Kingdom to assess the feasibility of using GLH data to inform human movement. We find that GLH data span very long temporal periods (over a year on average in our sample), are spatially equivalent to GPS tracker data within 100 m, and capture more international movement than survey data. We also find GLH data avoid compliance concerns seen with GPS trackers and bias in self-reported travel, as GLH is passively collected. We discuss some settings where GLH data could provide novel insights, including infrastructure planning, infectious disease control, and response to catastrophic events, and discuss advantages and disadvantages of using GLH data to inform human mobility patterns. GLH data are a greatly underutilized and novel dataset for understanding human movement. While biases exist in populations with GLH data, Android phones are becoming the first and only device purchased to access the Internet and various web services in many middle and lower income settings, making these data increasingly appropriate for a wide range of scientific questions.},

Despite the widespread application of BMA in the literature, there were not many accounts of these differences and trends besides a few landmark revisions in the late 1990s and early 2000s, therefore not taking into account any advancements made in the last 15 years. In this work, we present an account of these developments through a careful content analysis of 587 articles in BMA published between 1996 and 2014. We also develop a conceptual classification scheme to better describe this vast literature, understand its trends and future directions and provide guidance for the researcher interested in both the application and development of the methodology. The results of the classification scheme and content review are then used to discuss the present and future of the BMA literature.},

@article{Friedlander1966a,
abstract = {The main trend in urban/rural migration is a continuous gain, in net terms, of towns from villages and large cities. But this is a result of two distinct migration streams associated with the process of family formation. While before marriage there is positive net migration from villages to both large cities and towns (and from large cities towards towns), after marriage there is a tendency for couples to move towards villages. This is explained by the desire of families, particularly those belonging to the middle class to move out of the urban centres to better accommodation in smaller communities. Considerable variations in migrations within and into regions are observed. These reflect the continuation oflong-term trends in internal migration (as described in Part I of this paper) in particular, population dispersal from Greater London and larger distance migration into the Southern and Eastern regions. Some social characteristics of migrants and non-migrants are compared. Associations between the intensity of internal migration on the one hand, and occupational status, education, social mobility and family size on the other are observed. An attempt is made to assess the extent of migration associated with the marriage process. Although this process increases mobility, its relative contribution to total adult mobility appears to be only slight. {\textcopyright} 1966 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

Alternatively, it might be explained by atypical opportunities for building a rebel organization. While it is difficult to find proxies for grievances and opportunities, we find that political and social variables that are most obviously related to grievances have little explanatory power. By contrast, economic variables, which could proxy some grievances but are perhaps more obviously related to the viability of rebellion, provide considerably more explanatory power. {\textcopyright} Oxford University Press 2004.

Examining the direct, indirect, total, and negative demographic impacts of zero net international migration through simulations with demographic data, we demonstrate that zero net international migration is not the same and therefore does not have the same demographic results and implications as zero international migration.

@article{Bengtsson2011a,
abstract = {Background: Population movements following disasters can cause important increases in morbidity and mortality. Without knowledge of the locations of affected people, relief assistance is compromised. No rapid and accurate method exists to track population movements after disasters. We used position data of subscriber identity module (SIM) cards from the largest mobile phone company in Haiti (Digicel) to estimate the magnitude and trends of population movements following the Haiti 2010 earthquake and cholera outbreak. Methods and Findings: Geographic positions of SIM cards were determined by the location of the mobile phone tower through which each SIM card connects when calling. We followed daily positions of SIM cards 42 days before the earthquake and 158 days after. To exclude inactivated SIM cards, we included only the 1.9 million SIM cards that made at least one call both pre-earthquake and during the last month of study. In Port-au-Prince there were 3.2 persons per included SIM card. We used this ratio to extrapolate from the number of moving SIM cards to the number of moving persons. Cholera outbreak analyses covered 8 days and tracked 138,560 SIM cards. An estimated 630,000 persons (197,484 Digicel SIM cards), present in Port-au-Prince on the day of the earthquake, had left 19 days post-earthquake. Estimated net outflow of people (outflow minus inflow) corresponded to 20{\%} of the Port-au-Prince pre-earthquake population. Geographic distribution of population movements from Port-au-Prince corresponded well with results from a large retrospective, population-based UN survey. To demonstrate feasibility of rapid estimates and to identify areas at potentially increased risk of outbreaks, we produced reports on SIM card movements from a cholera outbreak area at its immediate onset and within 12 hours of receiving data. Conclusions: Results suggest that estimates of population movements during disasters and outbreaks can be delivered rapidly and with potentially high validity in areas with high mobile phone use.

Its central finding is that, as long as fertility is below replacement, a constant number and age distribution of immigrants (with fixed fertility and mortality schedules) lead to a stationary population. Neither the level of the net reproduction rate nor the size of the annual immigration affects this conclusion; a stationary population eventually emerges. How this stationary population is created is studied, as is the generational distribution of the constant annual stream of births and of the total population. It is also shown that immigrants and their early descendants may have fertility well above replacement (as long as later generations adopt and maintain fertility below replacement), and the outcome will still be a long-run stationary population.},

as well as a thorough explanation of the rationale for using simulation
methods to construct summaries of posterior distributions. Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods - including the Gibbs sampler and
the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm - are then introduced as general
methods for simulating samples from distributions. Extensive discussion
of programming MCMC algorithms, monitoring their performance, and
improving them is provided before turning to the larger examples
involving real social science models and data.{\textless}/P{\textgreater}},

@book{raymer2008ime,
abstract = {At present there is no unified treatment, drawing together models to allow a consistent and reliable set of migration flows, across countries. This text seeks to do exactly that, potentially improving policies, planning and understanding about migration processes worldwide, via the presentation of migration estimation and modeling techniques. These modeling techniques are explored from both frequentist and Bayesian perspectives. The vital concepts such as missing data and collection methods (and their possible harmonization) are discussed in depth, and there are whole chapters dedicated to both modeling asylum flows and forecasts about the future of international migration.},

@article{Bohra-Mishra2014a,
abstract = {We present a microlevel study to simultaneously investigate the effects of variations in temperature and precipitation along with sudden natural disasters to infer their relative influence on migration that is likely permanent. The study is made possible by the availability of household panel data from Indonesia with an exceptional tracking rate combined with frequent occurrence of natural disasters and significant climatic variations, thus providing a quasi-experiment to examine the influence of environment on migration. Using data on 7,185 households followed over 15 y, we analyze whole-household, province-to-province migration, which allows us to understand the effects of environmental factors on permanent moves that may differ from temporary migration. The results suggest that permanent migration is influenced by climatic variations, whereas episodic disasters tend to have much smaller or no impact on such migration. In particular, temperature has a nonlinear effect on migration such that above 25 °C, a rise in temperature is related to an increase in outmigration, potentially through its impact on economic conditions. We use these results to estimate the impact of projected temperature increases on future permanent migration. Though precipitation also has a similar nonlinear effect on migration, the effect is smaller than that of temperature, underscoring the importance of using an expanded set of climatic factors as predictors of migration. These findings on the minimal influence of natural disasters and precipitation on permanent moves supplement previous findings on the significant role of these variables in promoting temporary migration.},

@article{Kraly2020,
abstract = {In December 2018, the UN General Assembly formerly endorsed the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration. Louise Arbour, Special Representative of the Secretary-General for International Migration, said, “the formal endorsement of the Compact represents a resounding commitment to an international migration framework based on fact, not myth, and to an understanding that national migration policies are best implemented through cooperation not in isolation.” While there are formidable challenges to the implementation of the Compact, the mandates for the role of evidence in policy and program formulation have been expressed from stakeholders, Member States, civil society organizations, and migrants, throughout the preparatory processes. This paper seeks to share those voices vis a vis the call for research concerning data, research and analysis concerning international migrants and displaced persons, and will consider the implications for scientific initiatives for migration research and analysis and for global policy and goals concerning migration and sustainable development.},

@article{Tatem2010,
abstract = {Calls for the eradication of malaria require the development of global and regional strategies based on a strong and consistent evidence base. Evidence from the previous global malaria eradication program and more recent transborder control campaigns have shown the importance of accounting for human movement in introducing infections to areas targeted for elimination. Here, census-based migration data were analyzed with network analysis tools, Plasmodium falciparum malaria transmission maps, and global population databases to map globally communities of countries linked by relatively high levels of infection movements. The likely principal sources and destinations of imported cases in each region were also mapped. Results indicate that certain groups of countries, such as those in West Africa and central Asia are much more strongly connected by relatively high levels of population and infection movement than others. In contrast, countries such as Ethiopia and Myanmar display significantly greater isolation in terms of likely infection movements in and out. The mapping here of both communities of countries linked by likely higher levels of infection movement, and "natural" migration boundaries that display reduced movement of people and infections between regions has practical utility. These maps can inform the design of malaria elimination strategies by identifying regional communities of countries afforded protection from recolonization by surrounding regions of reduced migration. For more isolated countries, a nationally focused control or elimination program is likely to stand a better chance of success than those receiving high levels of visitors and migrants from high-transmission regions.},
