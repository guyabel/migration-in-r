description: 
  In many countries and regions, migration is becoming or already is the largest component of population change. However, migration data is often of poor quality, missing or provided without disaggregation. Methods to estimate migration have been developed by demographers and alike to help address shortfalls and provide a platform to better understand migration patterns and trends. This manaul explores methods for measuring, estimating and visualising migration, and their implementation in R. Readers will become familiar with useful R functions for handling migration data, a range of measures to summarise and compare migration systems, common estimation methods to overcome inadequate or missing migration data and recently developed methods to visualize migration patterns. Code samples and exercises are provided throughout the manual to build up the readers experience. Some prior knowledge is required on how to handle and plot data using the tidyverse set of R packages.

# Introduction

This manual covers a range of methods for handling, measuring, estimating, and visualizing migration data in R. These methods are based on several authoritative sources, including the UN DESA manuals on [*Methods of measuring internal migration*](https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/manual/migration/measuring-migration.asp) and [*Preparing migration data for subnational population projections*](https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/manual/migration/subnational-migration.asp), as well as the migration chapters of the IUSSP [*Tools for Demographic Estimation*](http://demographicestimation.iussp.org/content/migration). Additionally, we will cover many more recent developments in the field. By the end of this manual, you will have a comprehensive understanding of the various methods available for working with migration data in R, and how to apply them to your own research.

To make the most of this manual, we assume that you have some knowledge of using R, especially the *tidyverse* set of packages. If you're not familiar with R or need a refresher, we recommend working your way through an online course before diving into this manual. Some good resources for learning R and the tidyverse include: 

- [*R for Data Science*](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/), a comprehensive guide to data science in R, covering data import and cleaning, data visualization, and statistical modeling.
- [*DataCamp*](https://www.datacamp.com/), an online learning platform that offers interactive courses on R programming and data science topics.
- [*R Bootcamp*](https://r-bootcamp.netlify.app/), a free online course that covers the basics of R programming and the tidyverse.
- [*Tidyverse.org*](https://www.tidyverse.org/learn/), a website dedicated to the tidyverse packages with tutorials, articles, and other resources for learning and using them.
- [*Swirl*](https://swirlstats.com/), an interactive learning platform within R that teaches you how to use R in a hands-on manner.

These resources provide a comprehensive introduction to R programming and the tidyverse, which will be useful throughout this manual and in your future data analysis work.

The manual is organized into nine chapters, each covering a different aspect of handling, measuring, estimating, and visualizing migration data in R. Chapter 1 provides an introduction to migration data and concepts, while Chapter 2 focuses on handling migration data in R. Chapter 3 covers summary migration indices, while Chapter 4 is dedicated to estimating net migration. Chapter 5 focuses on describing and estimating migration age structure, and Chapter 6 covers describing bilateral migration data. Chapter 7 is dedicated to estimating bilateral migration, while Chapters 8 and 9 cover different methods for visualizing bilateral migration, including chord diagrams and Sankey plots. In each chapter, we provide code and data that will allow you to replicate the outputs we present, as well as exercises that allow you to practice the concepts covered in that chapter on your own. We also provide solutions to these exercises, so you can check your work and ensure that you have a firm grasp of the material before moving on to the next chapter. By following the examples and completing the exercises in this manual, you will gain a deep understanding of how to handle, measure, estimate, and visualize migration data in R.
